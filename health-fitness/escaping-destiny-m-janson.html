  <title>Escaping Destiny - M. Janson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul can no longer ignore whispers of dissatisfaction, calling on him to make a major shift in his life trajectory.  He was always one to follow the rules, play it safe and constantly exist in the background of his own life.  Work, friends and conversations are more and more blending together into a single, monotonous experience that he repeats on a daily basis.  At first he struggles to make sense of his discontent, trying his best to navigate through a seemingly careless world.  
Then, a chance meeting with a woman ultimately changes his life forever, igniting an unstoppable momentum within Paul.  As he learns to open his heart, he meets people that challenge his unconscious belief that he is pre-destined to a life with little significance.  His spiritual journey igniting from these events take him to exotic places, including that within himself which directs him to cultivate a rich, meaningful life." />
