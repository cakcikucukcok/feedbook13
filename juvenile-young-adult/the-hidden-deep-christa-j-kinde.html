  <title>The Hidden Deep - Christa J. Kinde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Homework, football, apple pies, and &amp;hellip; angels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvest time is in full swing when Prissie Pomeroy learns that something terrible happened in her family&amp;rsquo;s orchard&amp;mdash;making it hard to focus on school, especially when her best friends are distant and Ransom won&amp;rsquo;t leave her alone. As she meets other angels. Prissie is drawn increasingly deeper into their world and closer to its dangers. A kidnapped apprentice suffers. A chained door bodes ill. A tiny angel makes a big difference. A battle line is drawn. Everything Prissie thought she knew is about to change ... again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was trembling, which frightened Prissie even more than the pitch black. Crouching down, she made herself as small as possible against the tunnel wall. From somewhere in the darkness ahead came a sour note, off-key and unpleasant. She held her breath, listening with all her might. A dull &lt;em&gt;clink&lt;/em&gt; was followed by a crunching sound that reminded Prissie uneasily of a barn cat eating a mouse. She cupped her hand around her little passenger and curled more tightly, hiding her face on her knees as her heart sent up a silent plea for help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-from &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Deep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Blue Door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fantasy with a wholesome message and down-on-the-farm twist&lt;/em&gt;. -Kirkus&lt;/p&gt;" />
