      <meta name="description" content="Thanks so much for purchasing this copy of Nicholass Amazing Journey. I hope that you have enjoyed the book and that it is a blessing to you and your family. For each book purchased, one dollar will be donated to Naomis Village.&lt;p&gt;
Naomis Village is a childrens home in Maai Mahiu, Kenya offering loving care to 60+ orphaned children. Child rescue is critical, but it is only the beginning. Naomis Village offers holistic care through love, full nutrition, excellent healthcare, spiritual care, trauma counseling, and exposure to the world at large. Naomis Village actively involves their children in serving the poor to instill empathy and a responsibility to answer the cries of their peers. &lt;p&gt;
In addition, Naomis Village is empowering their children with a 1st world education through Cornerstone Preparatory Academy, a leadership academy founded by Naomis Village in response to Kenyas education crisis. &lt;p&gt;
The vision of Naomis Village is to see what started at Naomis Village, multiply into hundreds of similar hope projects across Kenya led by the Naomis Village children as they reach adulthood. &lt;p&gt;

But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 19:14&lt;p&gt;" />
