  <title>Sex and Fertility - Linda Woolven, Ted Snider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Infertility in both men and women has become a modern epidemic. Problems like erectile dysfunction now appear to affect more than fifty-percent of the population over the age of 40. It almost seems as though the most natural thing in the world is no longer second nature.
Sex and Fertilityis a comprehensive and fun collection of natural medicinal solutions to the modern world&#39;s most pressing problems of infertility and reproductive health.
Sex and Fertility examines ancient aphrodisiacs that have been resurrected and vindicated by modern science, and that are becoming available again. Combining tradition with modern science and natural medicine, this book will answer your questions about reproductive health, male and female infertility and libido, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, vaginal dryness, postpartum depression, low libido after birth, and will help women enrich their self-images and sexuality after menopause.
Also, because having sex and making a baby is supposed to be healthy and fun, Sex and Fertility has been written to be fun and easy to read for both men and women, and intersperses practical, easy to follow advice with amusing stories and fun facts." />
