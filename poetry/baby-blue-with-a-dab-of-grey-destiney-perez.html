  <title>Baby Blue with a Dab of Grey - Destiney Perez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kaia Hunter and her husband, Trevor, have dreams like every parent to someday have children to invest their love into. But Kaia and Trevor are no ordinary couple; Kaia has a chromosomal disorder that makes keeping a child full-term almost impossible. When the two become pregnant once again for the fourth time, they come to find a sense of hope theyve never had beforea new hope. 
Kaia had never known a perfect life and is well aware that it wouldnt magically become so. Upon a series of events, this new yet flawed hope becomes a way of life for her. But to keep this hope in hand and heart, she has to fight for it, for herself. Kaia doesnt find a perfect life, but instead, a blue-gray life that is perfectly imperfect. It isnt entirely ideal, but it is the life she is given nonetheless." />
