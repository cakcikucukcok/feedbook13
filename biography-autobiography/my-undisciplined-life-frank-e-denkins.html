  <title>My Undisciplined Life - Frank E. Denkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My undisciplined Life is a story that trails my life, my journey. It&#39;s about a little boy who didn&#39;t quite fit in and felt he was never wanted. For him, love never existed because he never felt it. It was as if his life was taken before he was given a chance to have one. 
This book was written because I know I&#39;m not the only man, not to exclude women because I&#39;m sure they experienced this feeling of unwantedness also. But I&#39;m not the only one to feel lost or to ask the question, why was I allowed to enter this world and feel like i&#39;m out of place? God has a reason for all of us being here. Some of us feel the pain more than others. Some of us set it so deep within that we have not a clue as to who we really are which sets us up for insecurities, self consciousness, isolation and living as well as becoming a lie just to fit in.
I pray this testimony allows u to release you from you.
Sometimes your situations are reflections of the mess you created
Thank you sincerely,
Enjoy the read
May our Father who is in heaven bless you." />
