  <title>Front Line Observer - Mark Loftin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;America, it&#39;s time to wake up and realize what the war against the family has done to our kids. My hope is that, in addition to telling stories about kids who have shared our home, Front Line Observer may be your wake up call.Front Line Observer is a mixture of stories and lessons learned from 29 years of working and living with kids. Included in these 29 years are 24 years of residential work with kids in foster care.I tell some stories about the kids, and share what my wife and I have learned about why kids are removed from their parents or are placed in foster care. I will tell about the damage done to our children by the disintrigation of the family in our society and by those who do not understand the value of our children. I will show how those in our society who are willing to destroy the family are hurting our children. I will share what we have seen about how the casualties in the war against the family are our children.Kids who come into foster care and into our home almost never come from familiesconsisting ofparents who are a mom and dad who aremarried and together. Instead, they come from parents who have chosen &quot;alternatives&quot; to the traditional family or to have counterfeit &quot;families&quot;. In particular, I will confront fathers whorefuse toaccept responsibility for their children and families, and present ideas on how we can motivate these fathers to take responsibility for their children. I will also present ideasfor anyone who wants to help children who are hurting from an absent dad, or who wants to join the battle in the fight for the family.&lt;/P&gt;" />
