  <title>Humility of the Brain - Prince Ezem Nacho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of our &quot;??world&quot;?? as we know it can be rightly illustrated when different parts of the human body (representing diversity in our world) went into war over supremacy, everlasting life and glory. This war was instigated by a fictitious little bird that was destined to live forever but had a bad dream one day that changed its life. In the dream, the bird was confronted for the first time with a sense of its mortality when it was revealed that the only individual living within its vicinity was going to kill and eat it. With the help of a guardian angel and a tortoise that lived five thousand miles away, the secret to solving this dilemma was revealed to it but not without challenges. The challenge was to get the different parts of the body that would normally work in partnership, to wage war on each other. This was to be achieved by advising these body parts that they were facing an imminent death but only one of them will survive, live forever and be crowned the queen or king of the body by the Grand Master of the universe. In order to be that part, proof must be provided to the rest that body parts that it was the most important part and without it, the body could not survive. The mouth began the war of words by claiming &quot;??I am the source of nutrition and without me all of you would die&quot;??, the hand quickly reminded the mouth &quot;??I plant, harvest, cook and bring food and drink to you.&quot;?? The brain waited for all of them to take their turn before it came in with a bang. But before the brain could have a go, the part of the body branded the &quot;??least important&quot;?? decided to hold the entire body system at ransom. The action of the least important part forced the brain to think twice and instead came in with humility hence, &quot;??humility of the brain.&quot;?? Which part finally emerged the winner and which part was branded the least important? Did the bird succeed in destroying the body and was immortality restored to the little bird? How does this story relate to us as different individuals, communities and nations occupying this one body called &quot;??the world?&quot;?? And, can &quot;??humility of the brain&quot;?? help humanity to understand that, the posterity of our world lies with the education of the bearers of the womb, through whom all came to being?" />
