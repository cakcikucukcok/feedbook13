  <title>Taken by the Wind - Ellen Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ellen Hart was named the 2017 MWA Grand Master, the most distinguished lifetime achievement award offered in the mystery community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Eric and Andrew have been trying to keep up a semblance of normal life, they know their thirteen-year-old son Jack has been having a tough time of it since they separated. They&#39;ve been concerned, but now they&#39;re terrified--Jack has run away from home. It happened once before, just after the separation, but then it was only a matter of hours before Eric found him. This time, Jack disappeared with his cousin, and the two of them haven&#39;t been seen for more than twenty-four hours. Desperate, Eric and Andrew call on private investigator Jane Lawless, a friend of Andrew&#39;s from years ago. Despite the fact that her business partner, A.J. Nolan, is now in a wheelchair and struggling with depression, Jane agrees to help out. But after examining Eric and Andrew&#39;s home, Jane&#39;s first impression of the case isn&#39;t good--in fact, she&#39;s not convinced the boys ran away at all. She thinks they may have been abducted...or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taken by the Wind&lt;/i&gt;, the latest riveting mystery from award-winning author and MWA Grand Master Ellen Hart, is a race against the clock for Jane and the terrified parents of two missing boys.&lt;/p&gt;" />
