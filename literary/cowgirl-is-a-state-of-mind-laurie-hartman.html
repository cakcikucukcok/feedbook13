  <title>Cowgirl Is a State of Mind - Laurie Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many things look easier than they really are. Barrel racing, ramshackle farm restoration and relationships are no exceptions, and all three are intertwined in this heartwarming novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split between the security of her job in a big city and longing for country simplicity, it takes a detour during a string of weekend rodeos to set in motion changes for Riley Montgomery. Riley follows her heart and buys a run-down farm, only to find that living in the country isnt what she expected. Her rookie mishaps embarrass her and amuses the locals, and further complicating things is the strained relationship that develops with the towns respected jack-of-alltrades, Jay Tapperd. Riley and Jay form the kind of bond where one would do anything for the other, but Jay doggedly stays out of reach emotionally. And although Jay helps her through a major setback, in the end its Rileys cowgirl spirit that drives her to roll up her sleeves and take charge of her life once again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not only do you feel the excitement and disappointments that Riley experiences but you feel her sheer determination as well. A must read for every horse enthusiast! says Shelley Schaefer, producer of Maverick Rodeos and Turn N Burn Barrel Races.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
