  <title>Grandlady&#39;s Insights and Inspirations - Alma Ceal Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each day we are embarking upon another yeara new opportunity to really look at our life, how we are living it, and decide if we like what we are observing. We have even a greater opportunity to improve our lives and be happier than we have heretofore imagined. We can start today, not by looking back, or by looking ahead, but simply looking within and paying attention. If we keep writing and mentally rehearsing the same old script, the scenes of the play will be repetitious. If change is what we want, then we must rewrite the script. The Bible states it is done unto us as we believe. How complicated is that? Take inventory, check out what the mind is inwardly telling you, and without doubt you will know precisely what you believe. It requires us to be fully present with ourselves, like the good shepherd watching and taking care of his flock. Remember, it serves no one to be beaten up or put down. Each day has a lifetime within itself. Endless possibilities!
This book is designed to encourage all the readers to be their authentic self and to know that being in Love with Gods creation is not sinful." />
