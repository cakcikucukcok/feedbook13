  <title>The Hard Way - Carol Lea Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A lifelong New Yorker, Private Investigator Rachel Alexander has lived through some rough times&amp;#8212;from 9/11, to a difficult divorce, to cases that have taken her to the depths of the city&#39;s dark underbelly. But when wealthy business owner Eleanor Redstone approaches Rachel to ask if she can investigate her father&#39;s murder&amp;#8212;a brutal slaying that occurred when he was pushed onto the subway tracks&amp;#8212;Rachel takes the case, plunging herself into parts of the city only its poorest residents have ever known. Because to solve Gardner Redstone&#39;s murder, Rachel must disguise herself as a homeless woman and live on the streets, searching for the dispossessed man witnesses say made the fatal push. In one of the coldest winters New York City has seen in years, Rachel is helped by a homeless Iraq War veteran, a man whose sad circumstances leave Rachel pondering her own fortunate life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From critically-acclaimed author Carol Lea Benjamin, a writer the Cleveland Plain-Dealer calls &quot;first rate,&quot; this is another illuminating look into the heart of New York, a mystery with heartbreaking characters, and a story you&#39;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
