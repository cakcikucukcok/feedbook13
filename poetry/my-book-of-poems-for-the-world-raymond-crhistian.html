  <title>My Book of Poems for the World - Raymond Crhistian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I hope this book will touch your heart concerning the many attributes of life I have shared with you.  Although I do not have a set style of writing I consider myself as being creative and versatile a God given ability and talent to create words with energy and emotions.  The variety of poems that are placed in this book are unique in their own way.  I pray which ever poem or prose enlightens your heart that you are able to embrace the words and share them with someone else.  I pray this book will help you to be able to encourage the life of someone around you and help to change the course of their life.  
Poetry is a spiritual gift of love concerning the many evolutions and cycles that this world we call the planet earth evolves around.  It is a gift of love shared by the muses of ones connectivity to bring an individual or individuals into a glorifying act of happiness and peace through each word, each line, each stanza and ending.  What you choose to grasp and take with you concerning my work I pray it will be with you forever.
My Book of Poems for the World is a mixture of my work.  According to how you feel at the time you pick up the book to read it.  I am certain you will thumb through the pages and say to yourself, I like this one or that one.  Just remember that any poem or prose you choose it is definitely up to your liking.  You will enjoy them all but everyone has a favorite.  I expressed many emotions and feelings in this book concerning the poetry and prose enclosed.  You will find poems and prose of, love, romance, humor, spiritual enlightenment, poems and prose for just a little food for thought.  On the spiritual side of it all I must say that the prose, Just One More Soul is one of my best works.  It deals with the lost soul and how you must seek God for yourself.  There is also, A Penny for Your Thoughts quite controversial yet it leads you to a higher power as one would say reminding you in the process of course there is only one true God.  If you would go deeper into the book and study it carefully I am certain that you are going to run across what I consider a little food for thought a prose I have written titled, My Shoes, My Bed, My Table if you really have a heart ticking in your body once you finish this one prose I am certain you will become more involved in what is taking place with those who are in need of assistance.  Not just the homeless but the widows, orphans and strangers who you turn your backs on daily.  I Cry from the Womb is based on the awareness all mothers should have due to their ability to bring life into this world, a child crying for their mothers protection (sensitive and touching).  
Although I do not consider myself to be a controversial writer I understand that some of my work does take some people into deep thought(meaning critics) and will cause them to think otherwise.  I must state because of my love for all mankind I only write what I know to be factual and true, what I have experienced and what I have researched in order that the truth does not get distorted.  Prose like The Whip, An Unpaid Debt, The Dim Light of Justice and a few others may spark a few thoughts concerning your creed, color or religious background.  I state it is time for a positive change to occur and if my work begins to reopen the doors of concern for everyone to put their cards on the table and show their hands then there is not a need to vote." />
