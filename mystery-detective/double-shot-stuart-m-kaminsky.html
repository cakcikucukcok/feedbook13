  <title>Double Shot - Stuart M. Kaminsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abe Lieberman: a strong, sympathetic Chicago cop. His love for his family is matched by his quiet, zealous commitment to do what is right.  Sometimes he&#39;s faced with some uncomfortable ethical choices in order to see that justice--rather than the letter of the law--is meted out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou Fonesca&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt; a world-weary guy who got in a car and just started driving after his wife died and wound up in front of a Dairy Queen in Sarasota.  He now makes his way amid bail jumpers and lost wives, solving the little cases and trying to get by.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do these two men have in common?  They are both created by one of America&#39;s best loved mystery authors, Stuart Kaminsky. Putting two of his most beloved series into one volume gives readers an introduction into Kaminsky&#39;s world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Quite Kosher &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Bright Futures&lt;/i&gt; and are two full length novels that Kaminsky fans will cheer at. &lt;i&gt;Double Shot &lt;/i&gt;introduces new readers to a national treasure in the mystery field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
