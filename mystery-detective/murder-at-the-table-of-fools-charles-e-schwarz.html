  <title>Murder at the Table of Fools - Charles E. Schwarz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a midget football banquet, five fathers attend to honor their sons and end up poisoned. Four survive, while one ends up dead. The Lonely Detective is one of the survivors, and suddenly, hes got a new, dastardly case on his hands. Who would try to poison a man at an event intended to honor his own son?&lt;p&gt;
The Lonely Detective first interviews the wives, his own included, to see if any of the women had opportunity or motive. He has to face the facts: everyone is a suspect. Along the trail, there are emotional social workers concerned with the childrens mental health. There are also cautious, politically correct detectives who do nothing but get in the way.&lt;p&gt;
In the wives, there is no shortage of suspicion, as the Lonely Detective discovers poverty, jealousy, and vengeance. Oh, and theres the bit about a mistress. Next up are the literary agents, out for a book deal, and TV personalities, too. The dead mans memorial is replete with media and cheerleaders. Honestly, the Lonely Detective cant get a break  until his case breaks itself apart." />
