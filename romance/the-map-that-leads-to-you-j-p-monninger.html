But that was before an encounter on an overnight train introduces her to Jack, a passionate adventurer who changes the course of her journey and her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwing Heather&#39;s careful itinerary to the wind, they follow Jack&#39;s grandfather&#39;s journal through post-World War II era Europe: Vienna, Budapest, Turkey--exotic places that serve only to heighten their feelings. As September looms, Jack urges Heather to stay with him, to keep traveling, to give in to the romance of their experience; Heather convinces him to return to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack has a secret that could change everything. And Heather&#39;s world is about to be shaken to the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Monniger&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Map That Leads to You&lt;/i&gt; is a breathtaking novel about love, loss, and the best-laid plans that are meant to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;" />
