  <title>Tragedy in the Making - Mzwandile P. Ntsonta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is entitled Tragedy In The Making. Its written after he the (author) experienced suffering, pain, struggle, and poverty for a very long time in his life because of wrong beliefs he subscribed to, wrong decisions and choices he have made. The truth is that people are overwhelmed by what they are going through in their daily living. People are trying so hard to make life work, and no matter how hard they try, they keep on failing. Because they are living their lives outside the parameters of Gods will for their lives. Tragedy in the Making is trying to live the life we have designed for ourselves versus failing to live the life that God has designed for us. When you keep doing things in your own way, instead of Gods way, you wont be able to manage your lifethat is a promise. The source of the suffering in this book is the result of mankind not comprehending the purpose and the plan of God for creating them.  When I observe and look around in the world today, I see a lot of ongoing suffering, pain, struggle, and poverty in Gods people as well. I believe you can agree with me when I say, Some of the things we see daily in this world are heartbreaking. Most leaders are responsible for the suffering and struggle that we see in peoples lives. Whether be the heads of states, heads of institutions, or heads of families. Somehow, we are where we are today because someone has led us there. The solution in your suffering, sorrow, pain, and struggle can only be found in one man only, and his name is Jesus Christ. He came to reconcile us with the Father. He came to restore us into our original state and mend a broken relationship between us and God our creator." />
