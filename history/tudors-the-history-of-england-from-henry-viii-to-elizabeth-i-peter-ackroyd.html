  <title>Tudors: The History of England from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I - Peter Ackroyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter Ackroyd, one of Britain&#39;s most acclaimed writers, brings the age of the Tudors to vivid life in this monumental book in his The History of England series, charting the course of English history from Henry VIII&#39;s cataclysmic break with Rome to the epic rule of Elizabeth I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in detail and atmosphere, Peter Ackroyd&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Tudors&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Henry VIII&#39;s relentless pursuit of both the perfect wife and the perfect heir; of how the brief reign of the teenage king, Edward VI, gave way to the violent reimposition of Catholicism and the stench of bonfires under &quot;Bloody Mary.&quot;  It tells, too, of the long reign of Elizabeth I, which, though marked by civil strife, plots against the queen and even an invasion force, finally brought stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, however, it is the story of the English Reformation and the making of the Anglican Church. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, England was still largely feudal and looked to Rome for direction; at its end, it was a country where good governance was the duty of the state, not the church, and where men and women began to look to themselves for answers rather than to those who ruled them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
