Brook trout fishing too, in this youngest Canadian province is spectacular, for when a brook trout goes to see and then returns to his native waters, he is fat, sassy and full of fight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Great light tackle sport is to be had around the Bahamas.
