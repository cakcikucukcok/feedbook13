  <title>The Burning Reality - Khan Raheem Raza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE REALITY of humankind has been known and shared among every being existing in this world. However, the &lt;strong&gt;BURNING&lt;/strong&gt; reality was somehow undiscovered, hidden, or lost within the people living in the generation today. And now in this twenty-first century, it is to be revealed through one mans brain, feelings, assumption, and reflections to what reality engraved in every heart is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components of &lt;em&gt;The Burning Reality&lt;/em&gt; has been found in the vast majority of devastating norms, cultures, rituals, and philosophies that are not thoroughly followed within the modern society where human in eyes of humans is not a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of the greatest people, whom are living or have lived among us, once went on to know what reality of humankind is about. Philosophy then took its steps, and interpretation came necessary. What it showed was just about success but never was anything told about what it means for a human or the humanity. Never had it even been known to us with examples or real-life stories. But now, its available and would further be expanding in your heart after you get to know &lt;em&gt;The Burning Reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for, the first time after ages, all parts of reality came together in hope to see repentance from all who gets to know it. When we are to recall the most honorable and wise teachers, then we usually name them as Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, or Galileo. However, we forget what other great teachers have said. These include Seneca, Epictetus, Buddha, Aurelius, and Ovid, who also imparted special wisdom. And so for people reading this book, I bring them alive once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book features two poems relating to the concepts that mattered, six short dramatised experiences, and interviews of a few men and women specialised in different position, and a vast majority of revealed reality based in the concepts of love, life, relationship, money, and success through definite interpretation of philosophy and implied use of psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book itself pulls back the buried reality where the need of money, the importance of good relationship, the need of love, the approach to success, and the way of living a wise life have been drowned by all humans. The book would also guide you on how to repent your life by understanding and applying to what is told in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Burning Reality&lt;/em&gt; tells you the type of human you and others around you are. &lt;em&gt;The Burning Reality&lt;/em&gt; shows you how you and others around you are behaving. &lt;em&gt;The Burning Reality&lt;/em&gt; announces you what the world is feeling about you because this book has somehow been living in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE BURNING REALITY&lt;/em&gt;, YOUVE NEVER KNOWN, IS HELD IN YOUR COLD HANDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
