        HOW DO I RECEIVE THESE WRITINGS
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        FROM JESUS HEART
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I am asked how do you receive these writings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I will explain in order that Jesus, JESUS may be glorified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The majority of the writings come as I am in devotions. Usually the first line will come into my mind and I will go to my computer or to a scratch pad
        and write or type that first line down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Most of the time then the rest of the lines will come quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Some times the next line is not there and I will just bow my head and wait and soon the next line comes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I hear the lines as they come, not audibly but strong just almost audible.  The voice comes generally from a spot just behind my right shoulder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I am continually amazed at the words and power of these writings and fully realize that they are far far beyond and above my natural ability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My wife sees me crying and worshiping and typing the words as they come.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        At one time as I was at my computer, tearfully, joyfully, writing the Words of My Lord, she looked in from the next room and, in THE SPIRIT, saw Jesus
        standing behind my chair, back a few feet and also saw an angel standing close behind me, bent over my shoulder, looking at what I was typing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        These writings are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        FROM JESUS HEART
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        TO MY HEART
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        TO YOUR HEART.
    &lt;/p&gt;
