  <title>The Complete and Utter History of the World According to Samuel Stewart Aged 9 - Sarah Burton, Alex Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When his teacher sets the class a History project, Sam cannot choose which bit of History he prefers, so decides to do ALL OF IT. His version of History is a rumbustious collection of half-remembered facts, assembled roughly in the right order, and glued together with alarmingly confident misunderstanding. And yet our endearing narrator somehow inadvertently hits the nail on the head every time - as when he sagely observes that the Suffragettes&#39; hunger strikes paid off &#39;in the name of Female Emaciation&#39;, or that before Shakespeare came along &#39;everyone had been a bit rubbish at poetry&#39; (notwithstanding &#39;Jeffrey Chortler, saviour of the Middle Agers&#39;). Sam takes us from Ancient Egypt right up to Last Week with the flair of a bright-eyed nine-year-old. Rumour has it he is now working on an even more ambitious tome, The Entire World and Everything In It." />
