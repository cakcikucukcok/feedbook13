      <meta name="description" content="Lancelot The Wizards Cat is one of those cats who loves to get in and out of the most fantastic adventures ever. His master the Wizard does tend to be a bit on the old side in the way he tells Lancelot off because he has a bad temper that old people have with their cats if they love them. It really is not that much of a temper but Lancelot is quite mischievous anyway so there. 
This collection of short stories tells of funny and exciting mishaps that Lancelot gets up to with his master and the stories in this book are magical and enchanting. 
There are magic twists and wonderful turns and leaps of funny and amazing accidents that will have you in stitches or maybe you might be magically turned into a tasty treat to be eaten up? 
That is a fantastic coincidence for Lancelot. 
Does this give you a clue? 
The clues are this - Lancelot, magic, a beach and a crummy temper. 
The most wonderful clue of all for you to bear in mind is this... 
There are no ideas too bold for Lancelot to magic with a certain tail in mind. 
He is the cleverest and stunningly magically wonderous cat you will ever meet. 
This is what the wizard knows. 
This is what you will know. 
Treasure this idea in your heart as you read this book of tales of feline funny fun. Magic." />
