  <title>The Simple Things - Brenda Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BIOGRAPHY
Brenda Roberts lives in the foothills of The Great Smoky Mountains, in Maryville, Tennessee, with her husband of 46 years.  They have one son and two grand girls.  She enjoys having coffee on their covered front porch and taking in the beautiful view of four mountain ranges in the distance.  As an Air Force wife, she accompanied her husband over 30 years of travel throughout the United States and Overseas.  Raised in East Tennessee, she comes from a loving family of seven children.
Brenda has always loved poetry and has written many poems on scratch paper throughout her life.  She often shared her poems with family and friends and was encouraged to take them out of her green plastic folder and publish them.   Her poems are her story, life experiences and memories of family and friends.  The poems were mostly written after she was diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease in 2005.  Often she could not sleep at night so she would try and write and found that it helped her to relax.  
This book of poems is important to Brenda and is her gift to leave as memories of her life story of family and friends.  She hopes that those who read her poems will conjure up fond memories, laughter, joy, encouragement and excitement to the reader." />
