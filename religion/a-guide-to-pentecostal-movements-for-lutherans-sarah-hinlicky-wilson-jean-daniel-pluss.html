  <title>A Guide to Pentecostal Movements for Lutherans - Sarah Hinlicky Wilson, Jean-Daniel Pluss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In just over a century, Pentecostalism has rocketed from its humble beginnings in an interracial congregation on Azusa Street in Los Angeles to a global movement counting more than six hundred million members. Confronted with the bewildering array of Pentecostal, Charismatic, and Neocharismatic beliefs and practices, Lutherans are often at a loss as to how to think about Pentecostals, much less how to engage them in positive ways that build up the whole body of Christ.  In this guide, Lutherans will find tools for just such an engagement. Building on a foundation of Pentecostalism&#39;s history and varieties, Wilson undertakes an in-depth survey of biblical teaching on baptism, the Holy Spirit, and spiritual gifts. The guide then brings innovative new lenses to bear on the questions at stake: the use of church history in defending denominational borders, right and wrong approaches to prosperity, the power of the Spirit and corruptions of power, and the role of experience in theological discernment.  Written in a style accessible to laity and clergy alike, this guide will strengthen Lutherans&#39; appreciation of their own tradition while enabling them to encounter Pentecostals as fellow believers in the salvation given by the triune God." />
