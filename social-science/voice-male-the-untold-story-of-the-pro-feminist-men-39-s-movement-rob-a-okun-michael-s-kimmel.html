  <title>Voice Male: The Untold Story of the Pro-Feminist Men&#39;s Movement - Rob A. Okun, Michael S. Kimmel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;VOICE MALE: The Untold Story of the Profeminist Men&amp;#8217;s Movement takes you inside one of the most important social justice movements you may never have heard of&amp;#151;the social transformation of masculinity. Although it&amp;#8217;s been underway since the late 1970s, it still largely remains under the radar of much of society.&lt;BR&gt;       Thematically arranged essays by leading experts and moving first-person stories illustrate how a growing movement of changing men has discovered in feminism the basis for redefining masculinity and creating healthier lives.&lt;BR&gt;       The longtime editor of Voice Male magazine, Rob Okun, introduces readers to men examining contemporary manhood from a variety of perspectives&amp;#151;from boys on the journey to manhood to men overcoming violence; from fatherhood and mentoring to navigating life as a man of color; as a gay man, and as a survivor. The voices of a chorus of women can also be heard in these pages.&lt;BR&gt;        Long recognized for articulating a hopeful vision of the future of men, Okun sensitively presents a vivid portrait sure to be accessible to a wide audience interested in what is happening with men. His many years as a gender justice activist have not just deepened his skill as a chronicler of the profeminist men&amp;#8217;s movement but also helped to strengthen his voice as a spokesperson articulating men&amp;#8217;s second act. Voice Male offers compelling evidence of a new direction for men and illuminates what&amp;#8217;s around the bend on the path to gender justice.&lt;/div&gt;" />
