  <title>SAI THE PANTHER - A True Story about an African Leopard - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 408&lt;br /&gt;
In this 408th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the African Tale of &amp;quot;Sai The Panther&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In about the year 1824 or so, years ago two little panthers were deserted by their mother in one of the forests of Ashanti (now Ghana). They were too young to get food for themselves, and would probably have died had they not been found by a passing traveller, and taken by him to the palace as a present to the king.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here they lived and played happily for several weeks. One day the elder and larger, whose name was Sa&amp;iuml;, gave his brother, in fun, such a dreadful squeeze that, without meaning to, he suffocated him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This frightened the king, who did not care to keep such a powerful pet about him, and he gave him away to Mr. Hutchison, an English gentleman, who was a sort of governor for the English traders settled in that part of Africa. Mr Hutchinson arranged to have Sai shipped to England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened to Sai you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, but out just what happened, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
