  <title>There Lies a Hidden Scorpion - Takis Iakovou, Judy Iakovou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Nick and Julia Lambros hang the &quot;Closed for Vacation&quot; sign on their Delphi, Georgia, restaurant, what they&#39;ve planned is a joyful trip to Tarpon Springs, Florida, for the wedding of Nick&#39;s godchild Kate to Alex Kyriakidis, the son of a wealthy hotel owner.  A reunion with Greek friends and family and a week&#39;s stay at the beautiful Mediterranean-style hotel couldn&#39;t be more needed--or deserved.&lt;br&gt;But from the moment Nick and Julia arrive in Florida, it seems like rest and relaxation are just not in the cards.  First they witness a car swerving out of control and into the bay, forcing Nick and his cousin Spiros to rush to the sinking passengers&#39; rescue.  Then, as a series of ominous warning signs and small disasters begin to close in on the wedding party, superstitious family members insist the pending nuptials are cursed and must be canceled.  Nick and Julia, responding to a desperate plea from Kate&#39;s father, once again resume the role of detectives as they try to uncover which of the young couple&#39;s family or friends will stop at nothing--not even murder--to stop Kate and Alex from exchanging vows.&lt;br&gt;For Nick and Julia, it&#39;s a race to clear the innocent, expose the guilty, and hopefully save a wedding that seems destined for catastrophe.  Takis and Judy Iakovou&#39;s colorful cast of characters and authentic Greek atmosphere make &lt;i&gt;There Lies a Hidden Scorpion&lt;/i&gt; a captivating mystery that promises to keep readers spell-bound until the very last page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
