  <title>Wilhelm II - Lamar Cecil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wilhelm II (1859-1941), King of Prussia and German Emperor from 1888 to 1918, reigned during a period of unprecedented economic, cultural, and intellectual achievement in Germany. This volume completes Lamar Cecil&#39;s prize-winning scholarly biography of the Kaiser, one of modern history&#39;s most powerful--and most misunderstood--rulers.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Cecil shows, Wilhelm&#39;s private life reflects a deeply troubled and very superficial man. But the book&#39;s larger focus is on Wilhelm as a head of state. Cecil traces the events of the years leading up to World War I, a period that offers ample evidence of the Kaiser&#39;s inept conduct of foreign affairs, especially relations with England. Once war broke out,  his generals and statesmen kept him on the sidelines. He was dethroned on November 9, 1918, when a socialist republic was established in Berlin, and he fled in exile to Holland, where he resided for the remaining twenty-three years of his life, working energetically, but to no avail, for his restoration to the throne.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print. These editions are published unaltered from the original, and are presented in affordable paperback formats, bringing readers both historical and cultural value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
