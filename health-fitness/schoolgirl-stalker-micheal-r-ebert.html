  <title>Schoolgirl Stalker - Micheal R. Ebert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jess Nuzzo accompanied her mother to the supermarket, she never saw him watching her.  And during the car ride home, she never noticed his vehicle behind them.  But just days later, the voluptuous teen found herself face-to-face with a deranged man whos been romantically rejected one too many times.
Now, in the face of great tragedy, Jesss mother and their cop friend, Pat Schmidt, struggle to track down the scheming stalker despite a sparse collection of clues.  But can they find him before he strikes again?  Little do they know hes watching  and listening to  their every movement throughout the quaint Long Island town.
Hes ready.  Hes waiting.  And hes set to drown their hopes for good." />
