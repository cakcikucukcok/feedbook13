  <title>Searching for Franklin - Neal Locke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Searching for Franklin follows the trail of thirty-six million dollars that once belonged to a Mexican Mafia Cartel.  The money being transported from back east to the cartel made an unexpected stop in Crown Oklahoma.  The money was accidently found by four police officers that know the money is drug money and they take steps to hide it as revealed in the authors first novel &quot;NO PLAN.&quot;  It has been over a year and the four police officers think the coast is clear so they decide to start spending some of their find.  The trail of the money takes a sudden turn when an ex-con burglarizes one of the locations some of the money was hidden.  The ex-con reveals to a friend he has a large sum of money and the Mexican Mafia is alerted.  The cartel and the FBI are doing everything they can to find the money.  An FBI Agent through his investigation has narrowed his search to the four police officers.  The cartel is following the trail of the ex-con and the race is on to find the money.  As the FBI Agent closes in on the four police officers the pressure is starting to take a toll on them as the ex-con takes the cartel on a cross country journey trying to avoid them.  The ex-con takes refuge with an old friend only to find he has been double-crossed.  The FBI Agent thinks he has the case solved but events leave him guessing.  The conclusion will keep every one guessing as to the final destination of the money." />
