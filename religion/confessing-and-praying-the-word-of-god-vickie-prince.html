  <title>Confessing and Praying the Word of God - Vickie Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Speak of Excellent Things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires to hear your voice through your daily confessing and praying his word!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Have you been desiring to talk to God in a way that brings you so close to him that you would know that his presence is right there with you, in you? If so, he also desires to hear your voice more than you could ever imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God released his word in the earth, through his Son, Jesus Christ, not only for us to have a guide for life but also that we would have a source by which we can communicate with him and connect with him so personally and intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Gods desire that the full body of Christ would all speak the exact same words, his words, to him with one voice and in one accord. For the Bible teaches us, that out of the abundance of our hearts, the mouth speaks (Matthew 12:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to experience change in your life and in your environment, then start confessing these scriptures today. In this book, you will find answers to a lot of the issues you face every day. This book is filled with over 1,400 promises from Gods word, and they are all yours for the confessing and praying!&lt;/p&gt;" />
