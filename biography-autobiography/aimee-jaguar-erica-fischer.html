      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Berlin 1942. Lilly Wust, twenty-nine, married, four children, led a life as did millions of German women. But then she met the twenty-one-year-old Felice Schragenheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was love almost at first sight. Aim&amp;#233;e (Lilly) and Jaguar (Felice) started forging plans for the future. They composed poems and love letters to each other, and wrote their own marriage contract. When Jaguar admitted to her lover that she was Jewish, this dangerous secret drew the two women even closer to each other. But their luck didn&#39;t last. On August 21, 1944, Jaguar was arrested and deported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of eighty, Lilly Wust told her story to Erica Fischer, who turned it into a poignant testimony.
