&lt;p style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot; class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;Why did these Church Fathers use such seemingly foreign biblical concepts? Could it be that influential theologian, Adolf Harnack, is right and these church Fathers implementation of deification reveal that the gospel changed from what Jesus originally intended after being exposed to Hellenistic culture? Not at all, at least, that is what this work argues. It does so, first, by comparing an overall understanding of deification in both Athanasius and Irenaeus respective writings. This section encompasses the first three chapters, which exhibit how the Fathers use of deification is immersed in their respective descriptions of salvation history, the Trinity, and Christology. Further, this work assesses Harnacks proposal by comparing the Fathers respective descriptions of deification with that of many Greek and Roman philosophers. Finally, this work seeks to propose that both Irenaeus and Athanasius contextualize the gospel by comparing the Fathers respective descriptions of deification with their respective understandings of scriptural authority and the rule of faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
