  <title>With Pen in Hand - David Pitzele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blood is creeping through the crevices of the grittiest streets of Chicago. Body after body, gang member after gang member as the fog lifts, it is clear there is a serial killer in the midst. The media fire quickly grows from a small local blaze to a roaring inferno of national coverage. An irate mayors patience is running thin. The task force assigned to the case needs to solve it quickly before the city is further tarnished and the pressure boils over. 
As Detectives Jefferson and Hector begin to help unravel the case, a new surprise lurks in the shadows. Could it be a fellow officer is the killer? Whoever it is, he is not afraid to turn his sense of justice on the detectives. Fearing for his life, Jeffersons wife is begging him to drop the case, the commander is demanding answers yesterday, and the caldron of stress and fear is threatening to tear his world apart. We are left writhing in the mess of emotions wondering if the detectives can solve the case before they become the next victims of the serial killer. 
Lives are at stake. The entire city is on edge. A nation is fearfully intrigued. And the detectives wick is nearly burnt out. You will be on edge as the house of cards begins to fall and the book masterfully comes to its chaotic final conclusion." />
