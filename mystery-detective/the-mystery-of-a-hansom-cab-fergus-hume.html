  <title>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab - Fergus Hume</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;In the dead of night on a lonely Melbourne street, a cabbie discovers to his horror that his drunken passenger has been murdered &amp;#8212; poisoned with a chloroform-saturated handkerchief. The killer, his motive, and even the victim&#39;s identity are unknown. The last person to be seen in the victim&#39;s company cannot be identified and has vanished into the streets of the Australian metropolis. The solution lies within a labyrinth of dark secrets, missing papers, evasive witnesses, and a deadly game of blackmail.&lt;BR&gt;Ever since the publication of this 1886 mystery, the two-wheeled carriage known as a hansom cab has been linked in the popular imagination with sinister affairs. &lt;I&gt;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&lt;/I&gt; was the unlikely first literary product of a young barrister&#39;s clerk and quickly rose from its obscure initial publication to become one of the 19th century&#39;s bestselling detective novels. Reputed to have inspired the creation of Sherlock Holmes, this ingeniously plotted, fast-paced, and engrossing tale remains a delight for lovers of Victorian mysteries.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
