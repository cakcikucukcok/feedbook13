  <title>Paulus of Tarsus - Verling Chako Priest PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let me go back and bring truth and love into my narration, and not pride in my passion for spreading to the Jews and Gentiles what I thought were His Words and the meaning of the Kingdom of God.  Saint Paul 
Channeled by Verling CHAKO Priest, Paulus of Tarsus presents the unique viewpoints on Saint Paul by some of the Bibles most fascinating and influential characters. 
Presenters Barnabas, Peter, Luke, and Jesus/Yeshua, share their remembrances of Pauls time in history. As each person lends a different perspective of Pauls life, Paul himself struggles in his attempt to set the record straight. He discusses how he lost his way on his Christian walk and even how he asks for Jesus forgiveness for incorrectly interpreting the Word. 
With brutal honesty, the Presenters challenge our belief systems concerning Pauls ministry and reinforce Pauls humanity and his willingness to give his life in service to Jesus and his word. But most importantly, they remind us to give our very best as we travel lifes road. 
A unique and stimulating read, Paulus of Tarsus reveals the true nature of Saint Pauls ministry and encourages you to look at his life in a new light." />
