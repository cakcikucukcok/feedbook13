  <title>Dissenting Views - Joseph E. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All of us, at some level, know that we are being lied to.  Some people internalize it and go on with their daily lives. Some ignore it completely. And still others latch onto fatuous opinion-makers whose daily bread depends on the very system they purport to uncover. 
Obviously none of this is satisfactory. What we need is to understand how the world works, how systems of power operate, what motivates its operation, and where it all originated. Much of this book is concerned with what are often called conspiracy theories  a label which, it is increasingly understood, is used to try and misdirect all thinking about these very concerns in relation to our own lives. For when one knows how the system truly operates, the only rational response is revolution.
This collection of Joseph Greens published work includes articles on political assassinations (The JFK 1o-Point Program, The Open Assassination of Fred Hampton), historical analysis (Critique of an Apologia for Santa Claus), film (The Beginning is the End of the Beginning: Regarding Watchmen), and philosophy (The Elusive Universe.) From government propaganda to popular culture  assuming that distinction even exists anymore  every subject is treated in respect to its epistemological implications." />
