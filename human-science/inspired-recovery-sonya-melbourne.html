  <title>Inspired Recovery - Sonya Melbourne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired Recovery is a compilation of true stories from people who have achieved their life goals while managing bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or depression. Julie Edwards has suffered from mental illness her entire life. The eldest of four children born into a destitute family in outback Australia in 1948, Julie was diagnosed with &#39;manic depression&#39; at age eighteen. Her experiences include severe symptoms of depression, mania and psychosis; numerous treatments including medication and electroconvulsive therapy; violent physical and emotional abuse through dysfunctional relationships; bereavement and loss, including the tragic death of two husbands; substance abuse; serious physical health issues; attempted suicide; complete breakdown and the development of additional psychiatric disorders. Medical treatment and pharmacology play a major role in the recovery process - but so does the human spirit. Now aged sixty, Edwards describes her life as &#39;filled with joy&#39;! Though a &#39;cure&#39; for schizoaffective disorder is not yet known, she has developed a successful strategy to achieve recovery and live a rich, full life. It is her story that has inspired her daughter, Sonya Melbourne, to gather and share these beautiful, true accounts as a message of hope for those who suffer from serious mental illnesses, and those who care about them." />
