  <title>A Gallery of Michigan Grain Elevators and Mills - Tom Decker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="n the past, the &quot;elevator&quot; was an even more important part of farm life than it is today. It was a place where the farmer could sell his crops and buy just about everything he needed to produce them. It usually included a mill that produced animal feed, and in the more distant past often also produced flour.   A Gallery of Michigan Grain Elevators and Mills provides a look at both the variety of mills and elevators serving Michigan Farmers today and those that served rural communities in the past.   Many of the photos are very recent, while others dating back to the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s are a record of structures long gone. Historical and technical details are provided wherever they are available. It is our hope that the reader will find this look at Michigan&#39;s rich variety of mills and elevators past and present both informative and enjoyable." />
