  <title>The Funeral Planner - Lynn Isenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Funeral Planner trilogy is brought to you by the Dignity Memorial Network, Legacy.com, and Eternal Image. Valuable Offers &amp; Content-Integrated-Ads Inside from additional sponsors endorsed by protagonist Maddy Banks include 1800FLOWERS.com, Forethought Financial Group LLC, GoDaddy.com, EchoSign.com, Heardable.com, The National Hospice Foundation, DNA2Diamonds, Cadillac Travel Agency, GotKosherInc.com, Andiamo&#39;s Italia of Metro Detroit, Eagles Nest on Clark Lake, BTB Burrito of Ann Arbor and a special tribute sponsored by First Capital Funding. Determined entrepreneur Maddy Banks finds a way to bring life to a dead business, heal unresolved grief, and discover the meaning of selfworth v. net-worth in a healing journey of entrepreneurship and love. Chick lit meets business savvy in Isenberg&#39;s second novel in which would-be entrepreneur Madison Banks has longed to run her own business since childhood, but has had only failures. Just when she thinks she&#39;s hit the jackpot, her business school nemesis, the slimy Derek Rogers, beats her to the punch. Disheartened, Maddy finds inspiration in the unlikeliest of places: at her best friend&#39;s funeral. Maddy believes funerals should celebrate a life, as oppose to mourn a death. With the help of her beloved Uncle Sam, a lover-turned-friend from business school, and handsome investor Victor Winston, Maddy launches Lights Out Enterprises (www.LightsOutEnterprises.com) and The Tribute Network (www.TheTributeNetwork.com) only to realize she might again be facing competition from Derek. If you ever wanted to learn about life celebrations, processing grief, or how to start a business, this is a must read.
