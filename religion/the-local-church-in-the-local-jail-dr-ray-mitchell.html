  <title>The Local Church in the Local Jail - Dr. Ray Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every county in every state has two buildings in common: a church and a county jail.  Inside every jail are individuals who will eventually be released.  Some will want to make a successful re-entry back into society.  Meanwhile, in churches are individuals who may be interested in reaching those in jail with the Good News of Jesus Christ and helping them succeed at re-entry and growth in the Christian life.  How will an inmate&#39;s desire to change and the church&#39;s desire to help an inmate change become a reality?  How does a church begin the process of discipleship?  &lt;em&gt;The Local Church in the Local Jail&lt;/em&gt; provides a simple and biblical model designed to equip any person with the &quot;how-to&quot; of jail discipleship.  Writing from the perspective of a pastor and a jail chaplain, Dr. Mitchell has the pulse of what the church needs for a powerfully effective discipling ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
