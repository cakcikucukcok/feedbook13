  <title>Day to Day Living - John Richard Hendley Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of poetry was taken from a variety of ideas, circumstances, and humor. These things exist in our day to day living, as the title implies. Ive selected many poems for this book that I consider some of my best work. In hopes I can share with you the reader some of my ideas and insights. I hope these poems will be uplifting and helpful as you make your journey through life. I have also thrown in a laugh or two. Maybe you can relate some of your own experiences in these words, as you turn the pages. I find it a pleasure and a joy to share a part of myself with you. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the pleasure these words might bring. Life can rarely be enjoyed unless, you share it with someone, and I want that someone to be you. I hope to bring you many more thoughts in the future." />
