  <title>Bucholz and the Blockade - David Luchuk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pinkerton Files&lt;/em&gt; is based on the new audio series starring &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s Michael Hogan. It sets the real cases of America&amp;#8217;s first private detective in a world of radical inventions driving a bitterly divided nation toward civil war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Agency founder Allan Pinkerton senses a conspiracy mounting against him, his sons and his operatives. Every step they take toward solving three seemingly disconnected cases draws them further into a conflict that will be their downfall. If Allan allows them to become embroiled in the war, they will never find their way out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bucholz and the Blockade&lt;/em&gt; sees Allan save his son from prison by putting him charge of a murder investigation but this hurried decision evolves into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as his detectives pursue rogue soldiers into battle and accused killers behind bars. Amid a catastrophe that leaves hundreds dead and agents marooned undercover, Allan loses touch with his son as he chases the most dangerous suspect of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
