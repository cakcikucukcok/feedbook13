  <title>It’S All About Relationship Part Two - Dominic Johnlewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything in life is built on the foundation of relationships. We engage in relationships, we are surrounded by, and we thrive in and through relationships. Relationships seem to be at the core of our everyday life. 
Yet, mankind, relationships and the world have moved so far from their original design. In this compelling book, you will be taken on a journey to discover what happened to the original blueprint for relationships and what God did to get it back. As we take this journey, you will discover amongst other things: 
	What went wrong to God&#39;s original design for relationships
	How the broken bond of relationship changed mankind and relationships
	How mankind spiralled out of control and what God did to stop the rot  
	What God did to get back mankind and relationship 
	How a new hope ushered mankind towards a new beginning
In this second of two powerful books, Dominic Johnlewis reveals a God that went to extreme lengths for love and relationship and what He did to gain back that which was so precious to Him: you and me. This book will change the way you see God, life, love, relationships, and you and your future. You will discover that it&#39;s all about relationship." />
