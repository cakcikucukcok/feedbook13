  <title>Roman Britain - Harry Scarth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the landing of Caesar in Britain we date the commencement of our national history. This is one of the great events in the life of the nation which renders every particular not only interesting but important; yet, the exact point from whence he set sail from Gaul, and the point of his landing in Britain, have been, and still are, matters of controversy. We have in &amp;quot;Caesar&amp;#39;s Commentaries&amp;quot; a circumstantial account of the enterprise. The &amp;quot;Portus Itius&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Ictius,&amp;quot; in the country of the Morini, is mentioned by him as the point from whence he sailed; the particulars of the voyage are there given, and the description of his landing,&amp;mdash;yet, owing probably to the alteration of the coast-line on either shore, much difference of opinion has arisen both as to the point of departure and place of landing.&lt;br /&gt;

The date of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s setting sail is fixed about the 25th August B.C. 55. His force consisted of two legions, the 7th and 10th, and the number of men amounted probably to from eight to ten thousand. His means of transport were eighty ships of burthen, and a certain number of galleys or &amp;quot;long-ships.&amp;quot; He had previously caused the coast of Britain to be surveyed by an officer, C. Volusenus, and had obtained from merchants and traders all the information he could procure respecting the nations of the island, of which they seemed to know little, or were unwilling to impart what they knew..." />
