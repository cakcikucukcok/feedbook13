  <title>I Am the Eagle - Arogun Olayinka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It all begins when an American Historian vanishes into thin air, on LIVE international TV. Sparking off an investigation; originating within the confinesof, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, of the United States of America;traversing the world. Exposing a plot, so diabolically sinister, as to threaten, not just existence as a whole but, reality, as we know it; extending to the farthest reaches of the earth; redefining the very essence of humanity.
A rich talented genius; He already has everything and, anything, any man might desire or, hope to accomplish still feels the need to prove himself! He is of the opinion that a hero was only as powerful as the strongest villian he ever vanquished. In a quest to prove himself ultimately the best, he decieded to square off against the best of the best.
You don&#39;t do any better than THE LORD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF! 
He sets aside to recreate the original language that was lost at Babel. The language he surmised held the very power of creation.
The one time the LORD&#39;S sovereignty was challenged, was contained by a confusion of tongues. 
He has found a way of reversing that!
Once again the very sovereignty of the MOST HIGH is challenged by, a puny human" />
