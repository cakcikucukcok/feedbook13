  <title>God&#39;s Interventions In Secular History - Kenneth B. Alexander Bsl, Jd, Deacon, Sherry Mobley</title>

God will use anything, even if it seems not to be logical. He uses Satan, men, nations, miracles, sinners, prostitutes, wars and just about anything He can lay His hands on all to glorify himself in His creation. He will call men His servants who don&amp;#39;t know Him. He will destroy the love of His life if they disobey Him. All of this he does in the name of love even though it may not seem so at the time. He honors and blesses those that are His. He destroys that which prove themselves not to be His. All his ways are just and righteous. He is our personal Father not some far off God living in a spirit realm we can&amp;#39;t understand. He is omnipresent (everywhere at once), omniscient (knows all) and fills all things. He speaks a Word and it comes to pass. He is always on time (His time) as He rushes to deliver one of His possessions. This book will reveal His ways most of which are past finding out. He will annihilate His enemies.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God&amp;#39;s greatest intervention history is that He created the vast havens and the earth from nothing visible. He created everything we can see and much we cannot. Man was the jewel of that creation and the earth was His focus. He filled created space and filled it with galaxies and trillions of stars and planets with distances between them to far to contemplate. He filled the microscopic world of quantum mechanics too small to see. He foresaw everything that was ever to exist in this physical realm and spoke it into existence with a word: &amp;quot;let it be&amp;quot;. He carved a section out of eternity, called it time, and included in it the physical heavens (universe) and the earth. His spiritual heaven was already created. He created all manner of life including man made in His image. His purpose in physical creation was to integrate this physical realm in the likeness of the eternal Spirit realm (heaven if you will) where He lives. One of the few specific prayers He gave man was: &amp;quot;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven&amp;quot; (Mt 6:10). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God began with &amp;quot;the heavens and the earth,&amp;quot; (Gen 1:1) but then chose to the earth, not the heavens, as the theme from which He chose to inhabit man.  Having chosen the earth, God now bypasses the angels (fallen angels included) and elects to deal with man. Man is first created below the angels with the expectation that he will rule angels and will in fact rule all of His creation (Psalm 8:5-6). From Adam&amp;#39;s many sons, God chooses Seth (4:25). Of Seth&amp;#39;s many descendants (Gen. 5), God chooses Noah (6:8), and from Noah&amp;#39;s family, He chooses Shem (11:10), Terah (11:27), and finally Abraham (12:1). Abraham has many children, but Isaac is the chosen seed (21:12). Isaac has two sons, Jacob and Esau, and God chooses Jacob to be the recipient of His blessing. He chooses His younger Son Joseph to save a world from starvation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God left the remainder of the heavens to the other nations of the earth (Deut 4:15). Most ancient civilizations worshipped Satan through the heavens or the pagan gods associated with him (Sumeria, Babylon, Canaanites, Chaldeans, Medes and Persians, Grecians, Macedonians, Asiatic nations, Native Americans, Romans and countless others.
