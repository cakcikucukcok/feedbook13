  <title>The Collected Verse of Rudyard Kipling - Rudyard Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="British writer Rudyard Kipling is a master of all genres and styles of writing. His most famous work continues to be &quot;The Jungle Book,&quot; but his expansive list of poems in &quot;The Collected Verse of Rudyard Kipling&quot; is an impressive array of intelligence and wisdom. Born in Bombay, India, Kipling was accustomed to the social climate concerning British imperialism and colonization. An avid traveler, Kipling saw extensive sights around the world and was in awe of the natural beauty of the earth. He also was interested in the societies and cultures that he encountered. His poems are a reflection of what he saw and experienced. One of Kipling&#39;s most influential poems &quot;If--&quot; discusses what it is like to truly be alive, to be virtuous, strong, and courageous in times of crisis. Going along with themes of colonization, &quot;The White Man&#39;s Burden&quot; is a highly-debated piece about British colonization and the relationship between white colonizers and the natives. Regardless of Kipling&#39;s feelings about the British occupation of foreign countries, his love of travelling is apparent in poems like &quot;Mandalay,&quot; a piece which praises the beauty of Burma&#39;s landscape and architecture. Kipling was able to appreciate a foreign land for its history and scenery, and &quot;The Collected Verse of Rudyard Kipling&quot; is a testament to the writer&#39;s love of the world as well as his love for the written word." />
