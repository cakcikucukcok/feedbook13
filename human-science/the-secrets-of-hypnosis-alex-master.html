Psychologists have used hypnosis for a long time as part of psychological evaluation and treatment of patients.&amp;nbsp; Some psychologists think that hypnosis is a form of dissociation, but that is a topic of great debate within the psychological community.&amp;nbsp; Anecdotal evidence proves that hypnosis can be a great help when treating the psychological aspect of physical problems like addictions or dealing with the emotional and psychological aspects of diseases like Fibromyalgia.&lt;br /&gt;
Because disorders like additions or Fibromyalgia have both psychological and physical components patients that suffer from these disorders must treat both the physical and psychology causes for the disorder.
