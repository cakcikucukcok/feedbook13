  <title>I Wish You Happiness - Elise Bradfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your soul is on a journey. Happiness, peace, enlightenment, passion, purpose, inspirationthese are all within your reach, perhaps closer than you think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe wants to reconfirm with you that you are a blessing. Release yourself, remember your gift, your purpose, and awaken from layers of protective forgetfulness. Feel the warmth inside you, and know that you are valuable to the overall progression of the species and the planet. You have a role to play; you are worthy of being heard and worthy of greatness. You know what you wish to leave as your legacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True happiness lies within the here and nownot in yesterdays memories or tomorrows plans, but in understanding that happiness comes from being at peace in the present moment. Embrace the sunshine and the rain, and draw lessons from all of those experiences, so you can sit comfortably in your natural state of happiness and bliss today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Wish You Happiness&lt;/i&gt; is an invitation to forgive yourself, heal old hurts, and remember who you truly are. It offers a journey of truth and awakening, helping you to realign with your path and wish everyone happiness on their journey home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
