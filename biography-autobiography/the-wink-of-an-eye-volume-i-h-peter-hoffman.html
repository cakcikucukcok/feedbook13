  <title>The Wink of an Eye - Volume I - H. Peter Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the author H. Peter Hoffmans wife, Doris, developed Alzheimers, a hospice volunteer was assigned to visit her once per week. Carole Fischer was not only a great help for the couple, but also paved the way to the creation of this memoir when she asked Hoffman how he met Doris. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Spanning from 1925 through 2002, The Wink of an Eye  Volume I chronicles the love shared between the author and his wife. Through vivid narration, Hoffman relives the many unforgettable moments he shared with his loving, wise, and beautiful wife. Amid time and distance, amid the terror of World War II and the pain of Alzheimers, the couple managed to keep their vow of sticking up and being faithful to each other until death parted them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lush with nostalgic letters and photographs, The Wink of an Eye  Volume I is a fascinating and inspiring true tale of a love that stood resilient through the test of time." />
