        &lt;p&gt;Though he heard her words, Trent Marlowe knew he had to be dreaming. What were the chances that Laurel would reappear after vanishing seven years before?

        &lt;p&gt;But now she needed his help with her troubled young son. Could she fight the desire Trent was reigniting?&lt;/p&gt;
