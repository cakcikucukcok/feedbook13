  <title>What She Needs - Anne Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Devon Mason and Con Walker are sexy, honorable, loving, and completely devoted. In other words...perfect. And what do you buy two perfect men for Valentine&#39;s Day? But when Con surprises her with a weekend in Cancun, Tory is excited--until she realizes Devon wasn&#39;t included. What she thought was the answer to her dilemma is now a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Con&#39;s turn to take control. After all, Devon got Christmas. And what could be more perfect for Valentine&#39;s Day than a romantic getaway in Cancun? Except Devon has other plans--for Aruba. He&#39;s been happy to share Tory with the guy he considers a brother, but his protective instincts are kicking in. The deeper Con falls in love, the harder it is to keep from ripping Tory away from Devon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later something--or someone--is going to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Cape May Trilogy is a standalone story and can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book 1: What She Wants&lt;br&gt;Book 2: What She Craves&lt;br&gt;Book 3: What She Needs&lt;/p&gt;" />
