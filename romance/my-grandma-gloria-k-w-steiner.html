  <title>My Grandma Gloria - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Graig discovered that living in Regal Bay as a Van Winkle had its perks. The very name of the family that grew the one-time fishing village into a major coastal city commanded respect and admiration. Not many in the town, however, suspected that some of those perks included incest with a lustful, insatiable matriarch of the family named Gloria. This was only the start of the discoveries Graig made as he entered adulthood in Regal Bay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I went through to the sun room, where Grandma was still talking on the phone. She still hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen me, otherwise she might have ended her conversation, or at least changed the subject.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how wonderful it felt having his fat dick pounding me into that mattress, Carolyn!&amp;rdquo; she was saying. &amp;ldquo;You really married well. Paul still has quite the stamina for his age.&amp;rdquo; I held up, staying in the entryway listening. I was shocked at hearing what I had. The idea of my grandmother still having a sex-life was hard as hell to comprehend, let alone her having it with another woman&amp;rsquo;s husband.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Let me tell you,&amp;rdquo; she began again, after having listened to the other woman, Carolyn, for a moment, &amp;ldquo;last night was the best night of sex I&amp;rsquo;ve had since Hugo died.&amp;rdquo; She paused again, listening. I waited. I saw her nod, before replying, &amp;ldquo;I know you miss him, too, Carolyn. We had so much fun swinging together all of these years. And now with Hugo gone, the last of the brothers, I worry that those wonderful days and nights are over for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wished that I could hear both ends of the conversation. I was getting pretty excited, just listening to Grandma&amp;rsquo;s side of the story. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, any of it. Grandma was listening to an extended dialog then, so I slowly walked in to make my presence known to her. She barely started when she saw me, and then started to smile when she saw the puzzled look on my face. She knew that I&amp;rsquo;d been listening, and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I remember your cousin well,&amp;rdquo; she replied to Carolyn. &amp;ldquo;I also remember that he liked to lay back and have us service him all night. Quite the opposite of Paul.&amp;rdquo; Grandma smiled up at me and nodded towards the wicker chair opposite of where she sat. I sat and waited, still listening attentively.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I don&amp;rsquo;t have any plans for Saturday, Carolyn. I&amp;rsquo;d love to ride up to Coos Bay with you, so long as your cousin doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind a fifth wheel along. And if Paul&amp;rsquo;s driving the van, maybe we girls can enjoy the ride in the back.&amp;rdquo; Grandma listened for a moment, and then laughed. &amp;ldquo;You might be right. We don&amp;rsquo;t want him paying more attention to the mirror that the road ahead, and driving off a cliff into the Pacific! Isn&amp;rsquo;t that how Lewis Pine got killed, with his mistress, back in &amp;rsquo;82? And didn&amp;rsquo;t they find his penis bit off and wedged in her throat when they pulled their bodies from the wreckage?&amp;rdquo; I think I gasped at that, and Grandma smiled and winked in my direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, then. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk to you later. My grandson just showed up, so I guess I&amp;rsquo;d better give him my full attention,&amp;rdquo; Grandma said. She was looking at me, and then I saw her eyes drop to my lap, and I think they even sparkled in that moment. That was when I realized that my dick had started to react to what I had been hearing for the last five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
