  <title>Birthday Party Murder - Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The whole town of Tinker&#39;s Cove is looking forward to the celebration marking former librarian Julia Ward Howe Tilley&#39;s ninetieth birthday. Lucy Stone, Miss Tilley&#39;s closest friend, dreamed up the party idea--at about the same time she decided she&#39;s not getting old without a fight. Noticing crow&#39;s feet and a potential jelly belly, she&#39;s resolved to exercise more and purchase some heavy-duty wrinkle cream, asap!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  That sounds like a plan--until Lucy realizes her daughter&#39;s fourteenth birthday bash, a coed sleepover, may turn her hair white overnight.  What was she thinking when she agreed to let Sara have the party?  Obviously she &lt;i&gt;wasn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; thinking about the hormonal rampages of young teens.  On her mind, instead, was the shocking death of Sherman Cobb, the town&#39;s oldest attorney, an apparent suicide.  His law partner, however, thinks Sherman was murdered.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poking about in Sherman&#39;s papers, Lucy turns up an intriguing tie between the dead man and Miss Tilley.  Meanwhile Miss Tilley&#39;s own past has come back to haunt her in the form of a mysterious niece named Shirley and a biker great nephew named Snake.  Soon no one can get to see the elderly librarian because the brash, bossy Shirley says she&#39;s &quot;failing.&quot;  Is Miss Tilley in grave danger?  Will Sara&#39;s party turn out to be a scandal?  Now, as a killer&#39;s ruthless plan rushes toward a conclusion, Lucy needs answers   fast--or else she and Miss Tilley won&#39;t live long enough to make a wish and blow out the candles on this year&#39;s birthday cake.  .  ." />
