  <title>A Dog Named Beautiful - Rob Kugler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An uplifting and unforgettable story of a US Marine, his extraordinary dog, and the road trip of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A beautiful, beautiful book.&quot; -- Jenna Bush Hager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When US Marine Rob Kugler returns from war he had given up not only a year of his life in service to his country, but he had also lost a brother in the fighting as well. Lost in grief, Rob finds solace and relief in the one thing that never fails to put a smile on his face: his chocolate lab Bella. Exceptionally friendly, and always with - you wouldn&#39;t believe it - a smile on her face, Bella is the friend Rob needs, and they spend their days exploring nature and taking photos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Bella develops a limp in her front leg. It&#39;s cancer, and the prognosis isn&#39;t good. Rob has a choice, either to let Bella go now, or amputate her cancer riddled leg, and see what the next few months would bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Rob, the choice is a no-brainer, and instead of waiting at home for the cancer to spread, Rob and Bella pack their bags and hit the road. Life is short, but the road ahead is long and winding, and as they criss-cross the country Rob and Bella meet remarkable, life-changing men and women who are quick to make friends with this incredible three-legged dog. &lt;i&gt;A Dog Named Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is a book full of inspiration, hope, love, tears, and laughs. Enjoy the journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
