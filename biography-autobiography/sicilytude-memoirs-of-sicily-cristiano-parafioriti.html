  <title>Sicilytude - Memoirs Of Sicily - Cristiano Parafioriti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of compelling short stories filled with moral values and valuable life lessons. Although focused around the traditions and lifestyles of the people of a small Sicilian town, this book covers a variety of sensations based on religious beliefs, myths, traditional legends, devotion, strength and courage, all characteristics that we often take for granted or that are somewhat neglected in more modern cities. It&#39;s about the love of a mother, the strength of a father, the curiosity of a boy, the desire to make the world a better place and the continuous search for a change, or ray of hope, in a world that has too often been oppressed and where people have been forced to abide by rules and standards that would seem rather odd for those whom have never stepped foot in Sicily. Yet, the faces, battles, defeats, hard work, hopes, successes and values of the characters and lands depicted in these stories will reawaken long lost emotions and perhaps trigger a deep yearning to rediscover them. &lt;br/&gt;" />
