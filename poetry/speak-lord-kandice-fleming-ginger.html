  <title>Speak Lord - Kandice Fleming-Ginger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born to extremely young parents on August 9, 1963. raised by my mothers mother a God-fearing woman, Mother Jimmie Ann Lewis who surely deserves honorable mention and more. I have always been an avid reader and I have always put my thoughts on paper. I believe it began while in Junior High I wrote poetry and short stories. I even entered a few contests; not much ever became of that. But what I would really like you to know is when youre young you make a lot of mistakes...my husband and I worked hard at getting our credit together so we could purchase a home and just so happens that we chose a realtor who was a scheista and then we purchased a house in the middle of the ghetto; imagine that. Well, needless to say they were selling drugs out the back door and shootin each other out the front door. I am a native of Pennsylvania but several months before my 38th birthday I pondered my circumstances and realized I had been in Harrisburg all my life and it was high time for me to leave. After I had this epiphany I was determined not to celebrate 38 years in my hometown. Hence, we loaded up the truck and we moved to Beverly, no we actually moved to St. Louis, MO; to the place of my husbands birth (he wanted to be closer to his family). After only 18 months there we decided to move one more time and we are now transplants to Arizona. Lets go back, I forgot to tell you that all the while the shooting and the drug dealing was going I was petitioning heaven and this was my prayer...Lord, please increase my quality of living. Dont know exactly what I expected but after leaving the city of St. Louis where someone would go joyriding in our cars every other night, arriving in AZ and paying six hundred and some odd dollars a month for a two bedroom in a complex that had a pool I was sure God had responded. Weve been in Arizona for 7 years and weve been blessed to purchase a 4,000sf home, we have natural children, adopted children and foster children and God has done exceeding abundantly more than I asked. Not only that I picked up my pen again and O the things that God has to say! Who knew?" />
