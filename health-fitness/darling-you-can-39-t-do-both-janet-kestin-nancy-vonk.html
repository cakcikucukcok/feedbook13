  <title>Darling, You Can&#39;t Do Both - Janet Kestin, Nancy Vonk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the award-winning advertising team, a creative, fresh and brutally honest guide to taking on the working world on your own terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janet Kestin and Nancy Vonk have built their careers on unconventional creative thinking. As two of the leaders behind Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty, they famously championed stripping away photoshopping, lighting and makeup to sell real beauty. After years of rethinking brands, they decided that they wanted to focus on rethinking the way we work—or, in many cases and places, the way our work doesn’t work for us—especially for women. They’ve tackled the problem in their hallmark style: by turning expectations upside down and shaking them. Soundly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darling, You Can’t Do Both&lt;/em&gt; is a smart, relatable guide for all of the women who embraced the spirit of Lean In but were left wondering where to start—how could they, in all industries and at all levels, really begin to change their realities and maybe even their companies, from the ground up? Janet Kestin and Nancy Vonk’s answer is that women need to start breaking the largely unspoken rules of business they’ve always tacitly accepted. &lt;em&gt;Darling&lt;/em&gt; will spark a new thread of conversation about women in the workplace—one that’s about new strategies for every woman with ambition who is moving (and looking) forward—with motherhood not a roadblock but an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
