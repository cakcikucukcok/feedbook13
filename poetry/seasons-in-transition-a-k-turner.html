  <title>Seasons in Transition - A.K. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love and loss serve as guides during our lifetime. Both emotional encounters evoke passion, culminating in waves of happiness and groundswells of despair.  Euphoria and turmoil are the expressive surges of electrifying sensations we encounter as we engage another solitary spirit on the path to discovery.  Seasons in Transition captures the emotive complexity of living a life in relationship to self, another, and the natural environment.
Seasons in Transition records the emotional roller coaster ride along A.K. Turners path to self-discovery and soul retrieval. Each page describes raw and powerful feelings universally familiar yet uniquely personal. It is an ageless tale of lost love, ensuing chaos, growing awareness and eventual wisdom.
I lived without you before, I knew I could again, I didnt want to. Life continues bringing joys Ive met before and new sorrows I dont understand. Turner captures the despair, loneliness, and self-doubt of a cast-out lover forced into a seemingly inescapable abyss.
She drove out of my life after seven years of calm. I watched from behind a curtain with tears streaming down my face only to glimpse tears of her own. That did not make it easier for me, only more real. Life consists of changes, but change, when it occurs, stops the routine of life and places it on momentary hold. There I was on hold, wanting the old and familiar back, daring not to let go of a life and a love, feeling helpless and hopeless. My other half had deserted the ship, and I alone must struggle in rough seas looking for something that I found once, unlikely to find again. She left as if escaping from a prison camp. Maybe we were both prisoners.
When Turner eventually encounters another solitary spirit on the search of self-awareness, turmoil is replaced by euphoria as their loves surges with electrifying speed and intensity. As the seasons pass, the relationship ripens and mellows to a delicious richness providing each with the joy of a loving life together." />
