  <title>Time of Fog and Fire - Rhys Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embarking on a cross-country journey with her young son, Molly can&#39;t fathom what&#39;s in store for her, but she knows it might be dangerous--in fact, it might put all of their lives at risk, in Rhys Bowen&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Time of Fog and Fire&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly Murphy Sullivan&#39;s husband Daniel, a police captain in turn-of-the-century New York City, is in a precarious position. The new police commissioner wants him off the force altogether. So when Daniel&#39;s offered an assignment from John Wilkie, head of the secret service, he&#39;s eager to accept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly can&#39;t draw any details of the assignment out of him, even where he&#39;ll be working. But when she spots him in San Francisco during a movie news segment, she starts to wonder if he&#39;s in even more danger than she had first believed. And then she receives a strange and cryptic letter from him, leading her to conclude that he wants her to join him in San Francisco. Molly knows that if Daniel&#39;s turning to her rather than John Wilkie or his contacts in the police force, something must have gone terribly wrong. What can she do for him that the police can&#39;t? Especially when she doesn&#39;t even know what his assignment is?&lt;/p&gt;" />
