  <title>Naked Heat - Desiree Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andrew ?Mac? McDaniel comes to Saddle Wells, Texas, and buys the rundown HanniganRanch. But he&#39;s not just in town to get the place back to its former glory. He&#39;s on a mission to find the drunk driver who killed his twin sister, and his latest lead has brought him here. Once he arrives in town, he gets more help than he thought he wanted from a group of locals who want him to feel welcome, led by the sexy realtor who sold him the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nida Beloit hands over the keys to Mac&#39;s new ranch, she can&#39;t ignore whatever it is that sparks between them. But even as undeniable interest turns to hot nights together, Nida feels Mac&#39;s obsession getting in the way of what could grow between them, and she&#39;s not sure she can stand by and watch him destroy himself when his investigation sends him on a path toward a potentially disastrous act of revenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
