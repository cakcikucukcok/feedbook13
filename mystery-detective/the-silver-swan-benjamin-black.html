  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Silver Swan - Benjamin Black</i></b> | The Booker Prize-winning Irish author John Banfield, aka Benjamin Black, writes a series of offbeat crime stories about a Dublin-based pathologist named Quirke. The Silver Swan is the second of the five novels he's written to date. It's also the first that I've read -- and it won't be the last.<br /><b><i>The Silver Swan: A Novel (Quirke): Black, Benjamin ...</i></b> | -- Benjamin Black (or John Banville), The Silver Swan 'The Silver Swan' is Benjamin Black's (alter ego of John Banville) second Quirke novel. There is something about Dublin in the 50s that makes sense for a noir novel. The rain. The brooding.
