  <title>39 Organic Juice Recipes to Clear Away Bad Breath: Eliminate Having Bad Breath and a Dry Mouth In a Matter of Days - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes, even with the best possible oral hygiene, we can&#39;t seem to prevent bad breath. This can become extremely frustrating and affect our confidence in so many different ways. Unfortunately, bad breath is not always a reflection of our dental health. Bad breath can be related to different digestive problems and the overall state of our gastrointestinal tract. The best way to prevent and solve this problem is to take care of our entire digestive tract along with our teeth.  The key to a healthy and clean digestive tract and fresh breath lies in the food we eat. Just like with everything else in our body, food has the ability to do some serious damage as well as the ability to heal us. When we talk about bad breath, there are some specific foods we have to consume in order to clean our mouth and destroy the bacteria responsible for these problems." />
