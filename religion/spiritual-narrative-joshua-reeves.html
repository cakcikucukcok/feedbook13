  <title>Spiritual Narrative - Joshua Reeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your spiritual narrative is your soul&#39;s story.  It is why you are here.  It is to experience what is ultimately most sacred to you.  Like a character in a story, you have a lot to say about what happens, but you have little to say about what the story is truly about.  The plot, the supportive cast, the epiphanies along the way, these are all examples of the spiritual narrative in action.     Your spiritual narrative is the one story that is true about you when all other stories seem to end or transform.  It is the last story standing.  It&#39;s your story of love and of living, of joy and of transformation.  The themes of your story belong to everyone, but when you live fully, they become uniquely your own.  To be able to answer for yourself, &quot;This is what my life is about,&quot; is to bring to your everyday living such a greater quality of being, decision making, and priorities that your spiritual narrative becomes stunningly clear, and consequently, your life more radiant." />
