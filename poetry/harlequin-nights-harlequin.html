  <title>Harlequin Nights - Harlequin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
 	This book is feelings, emotions and truths.  It is understanding, perception and freedom.  The words came from my soul.  They appeal to anyone and everyone.  These are the lyrics to the music of my experiences.  
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do after I graduated high school.  I had dabbled in writing here and there but never really considered making a living at it.  Mostly, I wrote about personal things, events and feelings that I needed to get out but did not want to share with anyone.  Through writing, I found that it helped me express myself in a unique medium that almost anyone can relate to.  It also provided a challenging aspect for me to attempt to articulate sensations that, in most cases, are almost indescribable.  
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	Realizing that I did indeed have something to say, I continued to write about people and places, events and emotions.  Then, slowly, I found that others were interested in what I had to say.  One place that I found early on was the online community DeviantART.com.  Finding other writers and artists at DeviantART sharing their beauty and truths through their artistry, I had to join.  I wanted to share my style and writings, hoping to get feedback and learn to hone my literary ability, if I indeed had any.  
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	Soon after, I found that artists did like my poetry and prose.  And they encouraged me to share more.  I found other writers and digital artists that inspired me.  DeviantART has been a great place to meet wonderfully talented artists coming together and sharing their craft for all to see.  
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	It wasn&#39;t long after joining DeviantART that I recognized the next logical step in my progression: publishing my material.  I searched for over a year, trying to find a publisher willing to take a chance on me.  They were few and far between.  Then I happened upon the Trafford website one day and my whole life changed.  They call it print-on-demand.  I call it the needle in the haystack!
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	I decided to write under a pen name because right now I feel my words and thoughts and ideas are more important than who they came from.  Besides, if you read my work, you already know me, in a way.  I want to inspire and open the eyes of the world.  I want to make people think about themselves and society at large.  
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
	I don&#39;t want to over-commercialize and get caught up in the pop culture spotlight.  I just want to get my words and ideas out to the people.  That&#39;s why I made my book as simply as possible.  I don&#39;t want the packaging to get in the way of the message.  If they like me, great.  If they don&#39;t, that&#39;s o.k. too.  Either way, I&#39;m doing what I want to do.  And I&#39;m making my mark.  Thanks for looking.
