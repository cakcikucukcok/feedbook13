  <title>Doddie: My Autobiography - Alex Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Alex &amp;#145;Doddie&amp;#8217; MacDonald was one of the finest footballers we have produced. As a midfield dynamo he had an incredible will to win, and his passion on the field and uncompromising style made him a great favourite with Rangers fans everywhere. Having set out with St Johnstone, his twelve years at Ibrox saw him win a glittering total of twelve medals, including a highly prized European one.   Doddie&amp;#8217;s football career produced some incredible highs and a few real low points. There was the Cup Winners&amp;#8217; Cup run in which he scored vital goals on the road to an historic victory in Barcelona, his memorable goal in the 1975 League Cup victory over Celtic which was the first part of the Rangers&amp;#8217; Treble that season, and a total of over 500 appearances for the club which brought him remarkable success at club level but only one cap for Scotland.   After moving to Hearts, Doddie was soon offered the manager&amp;#8217;s job and in 1986 took his team to within seven minutes of winning the League title. He now reveals the inside story of that campaign and his dejection at losing the title and then the Scottish Cup the following week. Later, as manager of Airdrie, he did the seemingly impossible and took the team to two Cup Finals as well as into Europe for the first time.      Doddie is the fascinating inside story of an incredible football career as well as a revealing insight into Alex MacDonald&amp;#8217;s early life growing up in Glasgow. As controversial and candid as the man himself, Doddie is a must-read for any football fan. &lt;/div&gt;" />
