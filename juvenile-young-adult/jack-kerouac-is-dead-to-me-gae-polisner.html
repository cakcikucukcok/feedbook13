  <title>Jack Kerouac is Dead to Me - Gae Polisner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Jack Kerouac is Dead to Me&lt;/i&gt; is an absolutely real, raw and emotional read, and it&#39;s a book that touched my heart with every page.&quot; - Katie McGarry, critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Only a Breath Apart&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old JL Markham&#39;s life used to be filled with carnival nights and hot summer days spent giggling with her forever best friend Aubrey about their families and boys. Together, they were unstoppable. But they aren&#39;t the friends they once were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With JL&#39;s father gone on long term business, and her mother struggling with her mental illness, JL takes solace in the tropical butterflies she raises, and in her new, older boyfriend, Max Gordon. Max may be rough on the outside, but he has the soul of a poet (something Aubrey will never understand). Only, Max is about to graduate, and he&#39;s going to hit the road - with or without JL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JL can&#39;t bear being left behind again. But what if devoting herself to Max not only means betraying her parents, but permanently losing the love of her best friend? What becomes of loyalty, when no one is loyal to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gae Polisner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Jack Kerouac is Dead to Me&lt;/i&gt; is a story about the fragility of female friendship, of falling in love and wondering if you are ready for more, and of the glimmers of hope we find by taking stock in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
