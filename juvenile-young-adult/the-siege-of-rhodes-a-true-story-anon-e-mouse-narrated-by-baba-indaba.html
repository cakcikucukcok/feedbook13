  <title>THE SIEGE OF RHODES - A True Story - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 214&lt;br /&gt;
In this 214th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of the Siege of Rhodes in 1522AD. If you ever read the history of the sixteenth century, you will notice that in Europe nearly the whole of that period was occupied by two struggles: the struggle of the Reformed religion against the Catholic Church, and that of the Christian world with the Sultans of Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the century began, the Turks had been lords of Constantinople for fifty years, and were for a while busy with establishing themselves firmly in the capital of the Emperors of the East. Then, as in the days of Mahomet&amp;#39;s successors nine hundred years before, they proceeded to look about for fresh worlds to conquer, when the Crescent should trample underfoot the Cross. In 1521, Solyman (Suleiman) the Great, accompanied by a vast host, marched northwards to Hungary, and after a two months&amp;#39; siege captured the town of Belgrade. This expedition was undertaken by the Sultan in obedience to the wishes of his father, who died before he could march there himself; but what the young man really longed to possess was the beautiful Island of Rhodes lying at a short distance from the coast of Asia Minor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The city of Rhodes was the stronghold of the Brotherhood of St. John of Jerusalem and the Knights had seen to its fortifications. It might be taken, of course; still the loss of life was sure to be tremendous and the Sultan possessed other islands as lovely and fertile as Rhodes. No doubt he did; but it was Rhodes he wanted, so Solyman turned from his old councillors and listened to the advice of his brother-in-law, Mustafa Pasha.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before Solyman attacks he sends spies into Rhodes to determine the lay of the land. Once he had received this information, he assembled a great fleet in all haste to bear his army through the &amp;AElig;gean Sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are invited to download and read the story of the valiant fight of the army of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem against the army of Solyman the great.&lt;br /&gt;
