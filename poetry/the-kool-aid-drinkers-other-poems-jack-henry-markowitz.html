  <title>The Kool Aid Drinkers &amp; Other Poems - Jack Henry Markowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the publication of The Kool-Aid Drinkers &amp; Other Poems the author
presents a collection of his more recently written poems. This new volume can be
viewed as a book end to his prior collected works which represents a collection of
some of his favorite poems that were written over a span of 40 years.
In his novella Stuff Happens author Jack Henry Markowitz combines elements
of fi ction and non fi ction in a new form he calls Friction - a combination of
the fi ctitious with the real. In The Practice and Other Stories he writes short stories
with satiric wit and Jewish humor about working class New York characters he
had observed during his growing-up years. With the publication of Bubbie and
Zadie Save the Day Markowitz retells a Romanian folk tale that his mother often
told to him and his siblings as a rather unusual bed time story
2005 The Practice and Other Stories
2008 Stuff Happens or My Life as a Monkey
2010 Bubbie and Zadie Save the Day
2011 Please Ask, Do Tell  Collected Poems
2012 Pandoras Box  New Collected Poems
