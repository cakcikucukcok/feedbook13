  <title>Shades of Man - Daymon Nicholas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry should come from the heart, it is not mechanical nor is it always sweet and sunny just as our lives are not always so. I have had people say my poetry is not very subtle. I am seldom a subltle person. Emotions are not subtle but raw and real. I can still feel the kiss of a remembered lover as if it were happening now.
How intense is the pain of loss that causes our heart to slip into the darkness. 
Below are some comments on a few poems from other poets.
TO CATCH THE WIND
that is very beautiful heart felt poem...a love that is worth everything even just for a few moments, even if you know it might not last... 
WONDERING ABOUT THE DAUGHTER
So sad, but lovely. I loved your memories you painted into this
WHEN WE MEET
I hope I feel that way again one day - thank you for reminding me that I once did." />
