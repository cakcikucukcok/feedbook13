  <title>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings - Annette Gordon-Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Annette Gordon-Reed&#39;s groundbreaking study was first published, rumors of
    Thomas Jefferson&#39;s sexual involvement with his slave Sally Hemings had circulated for two
    centuries. Among all aspects of Jefferson&#39;s renowned life, it was perhaps the most hotly
    contested topic. The publication of &lt;i&gt;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings&lt;/i&gt;
    intensified this debate by identifying glaring inconsistencies in many noted scholars&#39;
    evaluations of the existing evidence. In this study, Gordon-Reed assembles a fascinating and
    convincing argument: not that the alleged thirty-eight-year liaison necessarily took place but
    rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a fair hearing.&lt;p&gt;Friends of
    Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 1800, and most subsequent historians
    and biographers followed suit, finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of
    Jefferson&#39;s life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics by pointing out
    numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, ranging from inaccurate citations, to
    impossible time lines, to virtual exclusions of evidence—especially evidence concerning the
    Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been misguided by their own biases
    and may even have tailored evidence to serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson. This
    updated edition of the book also includes an afterword in which the author comments on the DNA
    study that provided further evidence of a Jefferson and Hemings
    liaison.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possessing both a layperson&#39;s unfettered curiosity and a
    lawyer&#39;s logical mind, Annette Gordon-Reed writes with a style and compassion that are
    irresistible. Each chapter revolves around a key figure in the Hemings drama, and the resulting
    portraits are engrossing and very personal. Gordon-Reed also brings a keen intuitive sense of
    the psychological complexities of human relationships—relationships that, in the real world,
    often develop regardless of status or race. The most compelling element of all, however, is her
    extensive and careful research, which often allows the evidence to speak for itself. Thomas
    Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy is the definitive look at a centuries-old
    question that should fascinate general readers and historians alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
