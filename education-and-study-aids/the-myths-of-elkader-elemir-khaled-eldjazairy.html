  <title>The Myths of Elkader - Elemir Khaled Eldjazairy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE LEGEND OF ELKADER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Elemir Khaled Eldjazairy and this is a glimpse of my life during my youth, I was born in Damascus - Syria 3rd of Nov. 1960, both my father and mother are distant cousins from the same family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple couple very humble and their main worry was how to provide me and my brother with proper education. I was born in Syria although my origin is Algerian due to the French exile of my great grand father Elemir Abdelkader to Damascus Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father migrated to Kuwait when I was 3 years old then Algeria, Libya, Scotland, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. and back to Saudi Arabia. My age was &lt;strong&gt;11 &lt;/strong&gt;years old and my brother Mohamed Omar 9 years old, when our mother Baraat got worried about our educational status, due to the continuous travel of my father Nizar seeking a job anywhere in the world, Baraat passed her worry to Nizar and told him that he should find a solution otherwise we will both lose our education especially when we keep changing from one country to another. So my mother suggested that he should send us to a boarding school and once they settle in one country they will bring us back. My father thought this was a good suggestion since he was in a boarding school in Lebanon, so the first thing that crossed his mind was Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
