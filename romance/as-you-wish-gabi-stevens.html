  <title>As You Wish - Gabi Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born into a magical family, Reggie Scott is content to live out her life as a normal human until the moment she&#39;s informed that she&#39;s a newly appointed fairy godmother. Left struggling to deal with powers the never thought she&#39;d have, Reggie faces a curse, a plot to overthrow the Arcani, and an entirely too enthusiastic mother--all in a matter of days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Bastion is a man of power and wealth--and a dangerous secret. He desperately hopes that Reggie&#39;s new powers will hold the answer to his problem and he isn&#39;t above using her to achieve his goals. What he doesn&#39;t expect is how much Reggie will affect him. Her honor, her honesty, and her strength quickly make cracks in his ruthless exterior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As danger from the Arcani swirls around them both, Jonathan realizes that what was once a ploy to get Reggie to assist him has become a battle to keep her safe and protected...in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
