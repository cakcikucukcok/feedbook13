  <title>The Distance from A to Z - Natalie Blitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This full-length novel by debut author Natalie Blitt is a pitch-perfect blend of Stephanie Perkins and Miranda Kenneally that proves the age-old adage: opposites attract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Abby has only one goal for her summer: to make sure she is fluent in French&amp;#8212;well, that, and to get as far away from baseball and her Cubs-obsessed family as possible. A summer of culture and language, with no sports in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That turns out to be impossible, though, because her French partner is the exact kind of boy she was hoping to avoid. Eight weeks. 120 hours of class. 80 hours of conversation practice with someone who seems to wear baseball caps and jerseys every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zeke in French is a different person than Zeke in English. And Abby can&amp;#8217;t help but fall for him, hard. As Abby begins to suspect that Zeke is hiding something, she has to decide if bridging the gap between who she is and who he is is worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
