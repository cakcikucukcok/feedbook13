  <title>Personal Discipleship - Benjamin Maira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The term discipleship comes from the word disciple. What is discipleship? Who is a disciple? These are two key questions we must answer if we want to understand personal discipleship. Discipleship is adherence to the Master and Lords faith. Discipleship has to do with two things: following Christ and making disciples. Discipleship happens when a person believe Jesus Christ for their Salvation and continue to grow to be like him daily. A disciple on the other hand is a devoted person to the Lord Jesus Christ, an adherent or follower of the Lords faith.
Personal discipleship is for today. Personal discipleship is of God. The Holy Spirit wants you to be a disciple and make other people disciples of the Lord. To be a disciple you need to have the following: salvation, the Holy Spirit, the anointing, devotions, witnessing, local church and pastoral ministry. Personal discipleship is new life of total commitment to the Lord.
I have written Personal Discipleship book with one aim: to introduce to you the best thing in the world, which is to know the Lord and make Him known to multitude of souls (Making New Disciples). Also like Jesus Christ brought to us two things: apostleship and discipleship, you too may be able to do these two things in your lifetime. Notice: Discipleship is to find and follow the Lord, while Apostleship is sending away for the gospel and the work of the Lord." />
