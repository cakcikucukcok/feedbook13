  <title>An Awakened Understanding - Bullion Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ministry of Imagination
An Idea of Impossible Progress - Immediately  
This is an idea on Awareness, and Higher Consciousness.  It is of the Presence we are all engulfed by: Divinity. 
 Nothing observed or described here should be interpreted to infer with any religious beliefs, labels or habits. Maybe reading here is a chance for expanding Awareness and will clarify your experience in a new useful perspective. This work is a collection of thoughts &amp; ideas. Here are different observations that I have been studying. The ideas shared are in a random order of commentary &amp; observations.  The reader can take from this what they find helpful or useful and leave the rest. 
My work is attempting to support individuals to live better within the global, regional, local community, while learning the new Awareness ideas of this evolving era.  
The Ministry of Imagination is assisting individuals to be  complete participants in our developing Cosmic Citizenship. It is the authors hope to create meaningful, rewarding, interesting, and satisfying relationships of cooperation and participation. Equipping and inspiring to live as students as well as teachers, as expressions and observers.
Hopefully some will find inspiration toward better living, both physically and spiritually. This is a pod of Thought Forms and as such they stand here alone. 
                     Thank you, in a common GOoD for us all!
