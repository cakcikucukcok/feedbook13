  <title>The Elsinore Vanish - Joanna Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A tragic death, an impossible murder &amp;ndash; this puzzle will need more than careful logic &amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious we should never have kept going. But stories feel different when you&amp;rsquo;re inside them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise. That&amp;rsquo;s my other excuse. I had no idea how bad it was going to be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ten months ago, in the Beechworth Town Hall, Tim Williams died horribly, poisoned with potassium cyanide in front of a room full of people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The murder was impossible. When it happened the poison was locked in a cupboard two kilometres away with someone sitting in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The police have got nowhere with the case, and now Matt Tingle and Chess Febey have been invited to Beechworth to see if they can get to the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It gets messy. Everybody is lying to them. There are two seriously big guys following them around in a van.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there&amp;rsquo;s a kid and who keeps showing them a card trick. The Elsinore Vanish. What&amp;rsquo;s that all about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then they see the van again, and this time it stops &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now they&amp;rsquo;re in serious danger. And Chess&amp;rsquo;s logic isn&amp;rsquo;t helping. If she wants to catch this murderer she needs a new pathway to the truth. She needs to learn to understand people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And she has to look deep into the mysteries of The Elsinore Vanish." />
