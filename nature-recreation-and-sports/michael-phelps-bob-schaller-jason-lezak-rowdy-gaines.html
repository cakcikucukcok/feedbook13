  <title>Michael Phelps - Bob Schaller, Jason Lezak, Rowdy Gaines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps is an American sports hero, perhaps the greatest Olympic athlete the world has ever known.

Filled with revelations, career statistics, and insightful analysis of how Phelps achieved the seemingly impossible, this is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn the complete story behind the legend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
