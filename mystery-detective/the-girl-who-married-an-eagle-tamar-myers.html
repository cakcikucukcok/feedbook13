  <title>The Girl Who Married an Eagle - Tamar Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on actual events in Tamar Myers&amp;#39;s life, &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Married an Eagle&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful addition to her Belgian Congo mystery series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Julia Elaine Newton, a young, pretty Ohio girl, volunteered to go on a mission to the Belgian Congo, she knew it was going to be a huge change. But she never expected to wind up teaching at an all-girls boarding school that consisted mostly of runaway child brides!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much to her chagrin, Buakane was born beautiful. If only she&amp;#39;d been ugly, Chief Eagle would not have noticed her. Escaping from an arranged marriage, the scrappy young girl finds her way to Julia Newton and the school. But this time her jilted husband will not be denied. Now it&amp;#39;s up to Julia and Buakane to try to save the school as Congolese independence looms and Chief Eagle is set on revenge. With the help of Cripple, Cripple&amp;#39;s husband, and even Amanda Brown, these plucky women must learn to save themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
