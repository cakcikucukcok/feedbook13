&lt;br /&gt;
How you can rank for keywords on the biggest book platform in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;
Tips and tricks to get an E-Book, paperback and audiobook out there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Everything you need to know about using promos to your advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Price strategies that make a huge difference in your revenue streams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How to use social media, squeeze pages, email lists and other online tools to market your books.&lt;br /&gt;
How to use series, excerpts, cross-promotions and bundles to make more money.&lt;br /&gt;
Suggestions for gathering reviews.&lt;br /&gt;
Tips for gambling a bit with ads and calculating your profit.&lt;br /&gt;
How to use affiliate links to earn a little extra every month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
