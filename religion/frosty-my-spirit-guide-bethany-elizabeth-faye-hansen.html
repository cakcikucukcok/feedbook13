  <title>Frosty My Spirit Guide - Bethany-Elizabeth Faye Hansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FOREWORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does the word &lt;em&gt;death &lt;/em&gt;come from anyway? Why do we call it death and what makes people dead? They are more alive than we are. Weve all heard the expression, It was like hugging a dead tree. Well, some people who are living are deador seem like they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we so afraid of death? Is it the word &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;the way it feels on our tongue or the way the word death &lt;em&gt;feels &lt;/em&gt;to us? Why are we not able to celebrate our loved ones transition into a higher level of being? Is it only because we think we are being separated from themthat they are being ripped away from us? But just because we think they aredoes that mean that they actually are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy is for the living, and transitioning into spirit is euphoric with joy. This book is about connecting with those that we love. Its about realizing that we are still connected and always can be. Its about believing in our loved ones love for us, and that they have transitioned to help us and to teach us about being more in our hearts. All we have to do is stopjust stop, and listen, using our hearts instead of our minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just stop, then listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you hear them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
