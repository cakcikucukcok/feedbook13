Laura can&#39;t resist the added excitement that comes with saying yes when a hunky man off the street proposes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FBI agent David Abruzzo has been working undercover as a thug to bring down the Zacolli crime family, but his cover depends on convincing the mob he came to Vegas for a quickie wedding. If they catch on to his plan, his cover&#39;s blown, and he&#39;s as good as dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of 48 hours, David and Laura use rollercoasters, glowing condoms, and exotic male dancers to stay alive and bring the crime family down. But it will take more than Lady Luck, one night of passion, and a little Vegas magic to turn their fake marriage into something real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
