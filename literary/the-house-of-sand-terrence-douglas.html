  <title>The House of Sand - Terrence Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The House of Sand&lt;/i&gt; is not a story directed at the excesses of the House of Saud and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; nor is it a veiled reference to present-day Bahrain or Yemen and their exclusive ruling families, nor even to the once privileged  now embattled or deposed families of Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, or elsewhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, &lt;i&gt;The House of Sand&lt;/i&gt; is a story about the greed, ambition, self-absorption of ruling classes wherever they reside, who are not responsive to the aspirations of the people, the international political forces that prop up such regimes, and the business interests that despoil the areas. The story is about the ancient traditions misplacedbut eventually reclaimed, wisdom ignoredfor a time, and the courage of the people that emerges in the end to seize the opportunity only freedom can offer, but not impose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Terrence Douglas has observed the excesses and endemic corruption throughout the world in the course of his travels, always marveling how wisdom and courage stir just below the surface until the appropriate time when it reappears in the soul of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the journey across the desert from the perspective of Aziz, who embodies an ancient wisdom and integrity; his son, Sultan, who wields power only to satisfy his personal and exorbitant tastes and foibles; and Chester Holycross, so desperate to reclaim his business reputation, who is willing to stoop to satisfy Sultans every whim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supporting cast of characters offers the contrast and reliefsometimes comic 
that the story requires.&lt;/p&gt;" />
