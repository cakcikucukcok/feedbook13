  <title>The Vow - John Robert Faircloth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this taking of earthly life, I found God&#39;s presence.  Certainly not His purpose, but the silent thread He weaves so gently through pain, loss and heartache.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I found it in John, finding the strength to stay faithful to his post. Keeping a long, steady, quiet watch over his wife, his children and himself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I found it in the testimony of Sharon&#39;s words and actions throughout this journey.  Through the entire 13 months, no matter how hazy, painful or senseless each day became, she stayed true to her faith in Jesus.  Though her life became a whisper as the cancer bulged, the proof of her faith, what the Bible calls &quot;the evidence of things not seen,&quot; shouted loud and clear." />
