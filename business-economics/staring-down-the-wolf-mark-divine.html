  <title>Staring Down the Wolf - Mark Divine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A leadership book by former Navy SEAL and&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mark Divine, &lt;i&gt;Staring Down the Wolf&lt;/i&gt; focuses on harnessing the principles of purpose and discipline in life to achieve success. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to command a team of elite individuals?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It requires a commitment to seven key principles: Courage, Trust, Respect, Growth, Excellence, Resiliency, and Alignment. All of these are present in an elite team which commits to them deeply in order to forge the character worthy of uncommon success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Navy SEAL Commander, entrepreneur and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mark Divine (founder of SEALFIT, NavySeal.com, and Unbeatable Mind) reveals what makes the culture of an elite team, and how to get your own team to commit to serve at an elite level. Using principles he learned on the battlefield, training SEALs, and in his own entrepreneurial and growth company ventures, Mark knows what it is to lead elite teams, and how easily the team can fail by breaching these commitments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elite teams challenge themselves to step up everyday to do the uncommon. Developing the principles yourself and aligning your team around these commitments will allow you to thrive in VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) environments, no matter your background or leadership experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from his twenty years leading SEALs, and twenty five years of success and failure in entrepreneurship and ten years coaching corporate clients, Mark Divine shares a very unique perspective that will allow you to unlock the tremendous power of your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Mark Divine has a gift for creating highly effective dynamic teams. Mark interleaves key aspects of leadership, mental toughness, resiliency and cultivating higher plains of existence into a foundational concept of being an authentic &#39;Leader of leaders.&#39;  This book is indispensable for anyone looking to lead, build and foster an elite culture.&quot; -Mike Magaraci, retired Force Master Chief of Naval Special Warfare  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;From his time as a Commander in the SEAL Teams to building several successful multimillion dollar businesses, Mark Divine is an authority on building elite teams and leaders capable of tapping their fullest potential.&quot; -David Goggins, Retired Navy SEAL, author of New York Times Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Can&#39;t Hurt Me&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;To grow to your fullest capacity in your life and as a leader, we need to challenge ourselves. There&#39;s no one I know who&#39;s challenged himself more than Mark Divine. He&#39;s the perfect visionary to help get you out of your comfort zone and shattering the status quo.&quot;   -Joe De Sena, Founder and CEO of Spartan  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
