  <title>Love You Hate You Miss You - Elizabeth Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Get this, I&#39;m supposed to be starting a journal about &quot;my journey.&quot; Please. I can see it now: &lt;em&gt;Dear Diary, As I&#39;m set adrift on this crazy sea called &quot;life&quot;&lt;/em&gt; . . . I don&#39;t think so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been seventy-five days. Amy&#39;s sick of her parents suddenly taking an interest in her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she&#39;s really sick of people asking her about Julia. Julia&#39;s gone now, and she doesn&#39;t want to talk about it. They wouldn&#39;t get it, anyway. They wouldn&#39;t understand what it feels like to have your best friend ripped away from you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wouldn&#39;t understand what it feels like to know it&#39;s your fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy&#39;s shrink thinks it would help to start a diary. Instead, Amy starts writing letters to Julia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she writes letter after letter, she begins to realize that the past wasn&#39;t as perfect as she thought it was&amp;#8212;and the present deserves a chance too. &lt;/p&gt;" />
