  <title>A Hand for the Duke - Meredith Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Can the Ladies of the Wagering Whist Society help an impoverished modiste win the hand of a sought-after Duke?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tina Rowan is beautiful, talented&amp;mdash;and wants nothing more than to be free of her past. The illegitimate daughter of a baroness, she is being blackmailed by her own foster-father. She must rely on her flair for designing dresses to earn enough to pay him off. Starting a business dressing the ladies of Regency society isn&amp;rsquo;t easy for a nobody. But Tina has three aces up her sleeve&amp;mdash;her own amazing talent, her well-connected biological mother, and the helpful (if meddlesome) support of the Ladies&amp;rsquo; Wagering Whist Society.&lt;br /&gt;
The handsome, arrogant Duke of Warwick has grown up schooled in the &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; way for a nobleman to behave. Rule number one: do not fraternize with people of the lower classes. But when he has to introduce his beloved sister to society, he finds himself completely reliant on the beguiling woman he&amp;rsquo;s hired as his sister&amp;rsquo;s modiste. To his astonishment, he finds himself opening up to her and enjoying her company far, far too much.&lt;br /&gt;
When Tina discovers the true man behind the ducal title, her heart might very well be lost. But can the duke set aside his fa&amp;ccedil;ade and allow himself to love the only woman who could possibly make him happy?&lt;br /&gt;
It will take the combined efforts of the Ladies&amp;rsquo; Wagering Whist Society to see this difficult hand well played." />
