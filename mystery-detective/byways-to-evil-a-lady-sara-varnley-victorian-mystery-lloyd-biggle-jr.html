  <title>Byways to Evil: A Lady Sara Varnley Victorian Mystery - Lloyd Biggle, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The year was 1900, the place was London, and the night, an unusually warm one for September, began and ended with horrors. I was caught up in them almost without warning as I turned into a narrow, poorly lit, cobbled lane and instinctively slowed my pace. Ahead of me, where the passage took a sudden bend to the right, a small gas lamp glowed feebly, and its uncertain, wavering light produced oddly distorted shadows.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;Byways to Evil&quot; takes the reader through the rich atmosphere of turn-of-the-century London, from the drawing rooms of the wealthy and titled to the dim shadows of narrow lanes populated by London&#39;s poor, as detective extraordinaire Lady Sara and her &quot;secretary&quot; Colin Quick search for the solution to a series of horrendous murders and baffling robberies.  Lady Sara&#39;s giant cribbage board, her &quot;Byways to Evil&quot; twists and turns as much as their distorted clues as the murderers and thieves elude discovery. &lt;P&gt; Plotted by a master storyteller, full of details of turn-of-the century life and crime, this is a satisfying period mystery." />
