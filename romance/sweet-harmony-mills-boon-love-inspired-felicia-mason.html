        &lt;p&gt;R &amp; B singer Marcus Ambrose needed a break from grueling work and travel, and participating in a small-town music and film festival in Oregon was the perfect excuse for a little rest and relaxation. But he never expected to fall head over heels for the town&#39; s beautiful psychologist, who wasn&#39; t at all impressed with his celebrity status.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kara Spencer seemed immune to Marcus&#39; s attempts to woo her. Strong and independent, Kara wanted a man who believed in God, community and family, not flash and dash. How could he convince her that he used his music to inspire as well as entertain? That he couldn&#39; t live another day without her by his side?&lt;/p&gt;
