  <title>Best Friends Forever - Irene S. Levine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Men, jobs, children, personal crises, irreconcilable social  gaps--these are just a few of the strange and confusing reasons which may cause  a female friendship to end. No matter the cause, the breakup of a female  friendship leaves a woman devastated and asking herself difficult questions.  Was someone to blame? Is the friendship worth fighting for? How can I prevent  this from ever happening again? Even more upsetting is that women suffering  from broken friendships often have no one to confide in; while the loss of a  romantic partner garners sympathy among peers, discussing the loss of a  platonic friend is often impossible without making other friends jealous or  uncomfortable. Written by journalist and psychologist Irene Levine, Ph.D., Best  Friends Forever is an uplifting and heroically honest book for abandoned  friends seeking solace. Dr. Levine draws from the personal testimonials of  thousands of women to provide anecdotes and groundbreaking solutions to these  complicated situations. Offering tools for personal assessment, case stories,  and actionable advice for saving, ending, or re-evaluating a relationship,  Levine shows that breakups are sometimes inevitable. Although the dissolution  of female friendships can be difficult, Best Friends Forever teaches women to  stop blaming themselves and probing the wounds, and that the sad experience of  a broken friendship can make them stronger people, and more able to handle  their relationships with wisdom.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
