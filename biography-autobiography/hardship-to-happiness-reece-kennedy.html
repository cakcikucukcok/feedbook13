  <title>Hardship to Happiness - Reece Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Because outback Queensland was so vast and flat, author Reece Kennedys little boy imagination grew as far as he could see. This imagination was slowly infused with a far-sighted awareness from which he proceeded to develop a lot of questions about the how and the why of everything. 
In Hardship to Happiness, Kennedy shares the story of his life beginning in the Aussie Outback to boarding school to the whole wide world. He tells what it was like riding bulls to rolling cars and living to tell the tale. He tells of marrying the girl he dreamed about, having four kids in five years, and being grateful for every minute.
This memoir shares the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Its about realizing the world can give you all you ever wanted it to, or equally, everything you wanted it not to give you. Hardship to Happiness is about a journey that started out being directed by influences and has ended up being guided by attitudes." />
