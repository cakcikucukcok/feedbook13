  <title>Island of the Mad: A Novel - Laurie Sheck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Following on the heels of her exciting and widely acclaimed &lt;I&gt;A Monster&amp;#8217;s Notes&lt;/I&gt;, and with Sheck&amp;#8217;s characteristic brilliance of language, &lt;I&gt;Island of the Mad&lt;/I&gt; follows the solitary, hunchbacked Ambrose A., as he sets out on a mysterious journey to Venice in search of a lost notebook he knows almost nothing about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eventually he arrives in San Servolo, the Island of the Mad, in the Venetian Lagoon, only a few minutes&amp;#8217; boat-ride from Venice. At the island&amp;#8217;s old, abandoned hospital which has been turned into a conference center, he discovers a mess of papers in a drawer, and among them the correspondence and notes of two of the island&amp;#8217;s former inhabitants&amp;#151;a woman with a rare genetic illness which causes the afflicted to gradually become unable to sleep until, increasingly hallucinatory and feverish, they essentially die of sleeplessness; and her friend, a man who experiences epileptic seizures. As the sleepless woman&amp;#8217;s eyesight fails, she wants only one thing&amp;#151;that her friend read to her from Dostoevsky&amp;#8217;s great novel, &lt;I&gt;The Idiot&lt;/I&gt;, a book she loves but can no longer read herself. As Ambrose follows their strange tale, everything he has ever known or thought is called into question.&lt;/div&gt;" />
