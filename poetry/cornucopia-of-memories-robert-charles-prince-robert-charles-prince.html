  <title>Cornucopia of Memories - Robert Charles Prince, Robert Charles Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes, we become so wrapped up in our day to day affairs, we forget to stop and look at what is going on around us. What reasoning did we use before we did this or that? Questions we need to ask ourselves and decide if we made the right decision and if not, do we have the guts to admit it and try to change or merely make excuses for ourselves. After all, life is not easy for any of us. These poems are a reflection of lifes experiences, my analogy of things around me. May they reflect some small part of you that said, I experience that same feeling or thought. Hopefully you will find comfort in these Conucopia of Memories as you walk down the Autumn of your life experiences." />
