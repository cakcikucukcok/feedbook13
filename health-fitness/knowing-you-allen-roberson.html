  <title>Knowing You - Allen Roberson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a relationship tool plain and simple. Probably the best relationship tool you will ever have in your arsenal.
For people who are married or have been married for any length of time, it can jumpstart or enhance the communication process. The answers you give can now be recalled at any time, making you the perfect gift giver and expert on your spouse.
For those of you who are dating, it can help you with key decisions about your partner. The answers you receive can not only help you learn the other person you are dating better but also help you determine how compatible you may be.
Knowing You has been carefully thought up and put together. Its more than 350 questions were thought to give partners very intimate knowledge of each other. Asking and answering just one or two questions a day will, in no time, bring you closer together. After finishing Knowing You and writing down all of the answers they have given you in your book, you can be the perfect partner. With all of their answers written in your book, surprising them will be a snap and knowing them will be a pleasure." />
