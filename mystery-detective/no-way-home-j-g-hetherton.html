  <title>No Way Home - J. G. Hetherton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the journey home is the most harrowing. In this pulse-pounding series debut, J. G. Hetherton weaves a chilling story about every parent’s nightmare.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Investigative journalist Laura Chambers is back in her tiny hometown of Hillsborough, North Carolina, the one place she swore never to return. Fired from the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;, her career in shambles, she reluctantly takes a job with the local paper. The work is simple, unimportant, and worst of all, boring—at least until a missing girl turns up dead, the body impeccably clean, dressed to be the picture of innocence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Years earlier, ten-year-old Patty Finch left home and never made it back. But for the people of Hillsborough, Patty was just the beginning. Child after child disappeared; a reign of terror the town desperately wants to forget. Now that terror has returned to seize another girl. And another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the story Laura’s been waiting for—her one last chance to get back onto the front page. She dives deeper into a case that runs colder by the second, only to discover the truth may be far closer to home than she could have ever imagined. Powerful, intricate, and tense, &lt;i&gt;No Way Home&lt;/i&gt; is the next obsession for fans of Julia Keller and David Bell.&lt;/div&gt;" />
