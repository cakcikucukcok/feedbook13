  <title>Left - Theanna Bischoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Natasha Bell went for an evening jog, just like any other night - except now no one knows where she is. Not her sister, Abby - eighteen, eight months pregnant, and without a game plan. Not her childhood sweetheart, now ex-boyfriend, Greg, an introverted academic who could never bring himself to commit. Not her best friend Josie, a newlywed, born-again Christian, with whom Natasha recently had a falling out. And not detective Reuben Blake, who thought this case would be open &#39;n shut - a quick way to prove himself and move up the ranks. Missing person&#39;s statistics suggest Natasha&#39;s ex is the primary suspect, but what about the possibility of a stranger abduction? Or the possibility that Natasha left voluntarily or took her own life? What about Natasha&#39;s mother, who took off eighteen years before her daughter&#39;s disappearance? As days stretch into months and months stretch into years, the evidence that emerges seems only to complicate the picture more. &lt;i&gt;Left&lt;/i&gt; explores the ways tragedy and secrecy erode and warp people&#39;s psyches and their bonds to one other. What secrets might Natasha have been keeping? - and, for that matter, her friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Left&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In &lt;i&gt;Left&lt;/i&gt;, Theanna Bischoff deftly navigates a dense tangle of family, friendships, and affairs that comes loose at the centre with the baffling disappearance of the seemingly irreproachable woman everyone depended on.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Naomi K.
