  <title>Psychosomatic Theory - Juan Moises de la Serna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preface&lt;br/&gt;
Emotions are a source of life and pleasure, but when they acquire certain negative nuances and become chronic, they can contribute to the appearance of psychosomatic disorders.&lt;br/&gt;
These disorders are more frequent than one might imagine, especially because there is a great lack of understanding in the individual&#39;s overall health, how to preserve it and how to take care of it.&lt;br/&gt;
This text is presented as a first approach to the subject of psychosomatic disorders from a theoretical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;
Objective:&lt;br/&gt;
The aim of this book is to serve as a first approach to psychosomatic medicine, focusing on the explanatory theories of its origin and its &quot;function&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
A text to bring the reader closer to one of the most important challenges that medicine has taken on halfway through psychology, the psychosomatic disorders.&lt;br/&gt;
Target audience:&lt;br/&gt;
- Health practitioners who want to delve deeper into the effects of emotions on health&lt;br/&gt;
- People suffering from psychosomatic disorders and to their families, so that they can learn in depth about this new perspective of the disorder&lt;br/&gt;
- Anyone interested in learning how emotions can affect health and how to approach treatment from a holistic point of view&lt;br/&gt;
Topic&lt;br/&gt;
- Psychosomatic Approach and Psychosomatic Disorders&lt;br/&gt;
This section covers the origin of the explanatory theories on the psychosomatic approach, and what type of disorders are included from this perspective.&lt;br/&gt;
- The Psychosomatic Personality&lt;br/&gt;
In this section is analyzed the origin of personality, its formation over time and the health problems of an &quot;inadequate&quot; personality.  &lt;br/&gt;
- Approach to Psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI)&lt;br/&gt;
Considered as the last great contribution of health science, this approach poses a model for overcoming the limitations of medicine and psychology, which only provide a limited view of psychosomatic disorders. &lt;br/&gt;" />
