      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Frances experiences three major life changes leading her to a freedom allowing her to explore the Spectrum that makes up life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frances did all society expected her to do: Married a handsome sexy man, secured a high powered corporate job, and honored her Irish Catholic parents. However, the only unconditional love she found in her marriage was with their amazing dog.
