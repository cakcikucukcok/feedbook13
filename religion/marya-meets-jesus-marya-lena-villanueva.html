  <title>Marya Meets Jesus - Marya Lena Villanueva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ABOUT THIS BOOK
This book is about an experience I had when I was a young girl.  It came about after much meditation and prayer.  God answered all my questions like, Is He real?  Can He hear me?  Can He answer my questions?  Why did He send little children to live in homes where they are mistreated, abused, and even killed?  Does He still love little children?  Why do people treat each other in such mean ways?  How can a parent kill their own child?  Why doesnt God stop them?  
My faith was wavering.  I was finding doubts taking over all hope for a better life.  I wanted to die, or be adopted by some family who would love me because I was a young child.  I wanted to know what kind of work God had for me to do as I matured.  I wanted Jesus to bless me like He blessed the little children who gathered around Him in Jerusalem when He was on the earth.
God heard my prayer.  He called me by my own name.  He explained what is, righteous judgment.  He took me by the hand, and we flew from the redwood forest in Northern California across all the states to a large city in the east (which I later found out was Detroit, Michigan), dropping in on families who needed His love along the way.  I saw their needs, wanted to tell them about God, and how He could help them.  But Jesus explained that I was in spirit form, that they could not see me, though I could see them.  I could not help them at that time, but the time would come when I could do so if I remained faithful to Him.  I learned that we will be judged at the end of our earthly life by the way we treat all those around us, both in thoughts and in deeds." />
