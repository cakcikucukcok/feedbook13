  <title>Going by Water - Michael Coady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The same again, the old bell says — the roofs, the pillowed heads, the dreams, the tides — the same but not the same, this winter morning here. In his beautifully conceived, meticulously assembled new collection, Michael Coady, laureate of the home place, ruminates on and records the traces left by our lives. From the rhapsody of now&#39; through words of love and grief, / the earth&#39;s embrace, its constancy&#39;Going by Water celebrates enduring values and the mysterious triumphs of ordinary experience and everyday ritual. It recounts inherited as well as overheard and re-imagined stories. It ranges from the river traditions of his native town to take in a new Ireland and the newfound locales of Paris and beyond with their communities of the living and dead. While it sounds elegiac notes it pulses to the beat of music as a portal to transcendence. Symphonic in its orchestration, integrating poetry, prose narratives and the author&#39;s photography,Going by Water elicits from its catchment a universal human measure. WithAll Souls andOne Another it forms a trilogy unique in our literature." />
