  <title>The Fate of Ten - Pittacus Lore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sixth and penultimate book in the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling I Am Number Four series! For years the Garde have fought the Mogadorians in secret, but now the invasion has begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John is on the front lines in New York City. The odds may be stacked against him, but his best friend, Sam, has inexplicably developed a Legacy despite being human&amp;#8212;and he isn&amp;#8217;t the only one. As the pair tracks down Five and Nine amidst the chaos, they encounter another teen with powers. Whether she is a friend or a foe, however, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Six, Marina, and Adam are trapped in Mexico. They fought their way into the Sanctuary and were able to awaken the force hidden within, but they don&amp;#8217;t have any way to reach the others&amp;#8230;and the Mogs are coming for them in full force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garde are stretched thin. Their only shot at saving the world is to eliminate the Mogadorian leader once and for all&amp;#8212;but his fate is now irrevocably tied with Ella&amp;#8217;s. The Garde can&amp;#8217;t destroy one without the other.&amp;#160; And if they can&amp;#8217;t find another way to stop the Mogs, humanity will suffer the same fate as the Loric: annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This epic, action-packed science fiction series is perfect for fans of the Fifth Wave series by Rick Yancey, the Maze Runner series by James Dashner, and Orson Scott Card&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Ender&amp;#8217;s Game&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
