  <title>Bike Touring: The Sierra Club Guide to Travel on Two Wheels - Raymond Bridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1979, Bike Touring introduced tens of thousands of riders to the joys of bicycle travel, and quickly became the go-to reference for an entire generation of bike-touring enthusiasts. But much has changed in the last three decadesâ??and this fully revamped edition provides authoritative information on both the latest equipment and the ever-expanding universe of touring options for a whole new generation of riders. Readers learn how to train, equip, plan, and pack for tours of any length and difficulty, from overnight trips near home to multiweek journeys abroad. Author Raymond Bridge surveys the wide range of touring options, which now include extensive commercial offerings and roof-to-roof (or â??credit cardâ?) tours, as well as independent, self-contained travel. Chapters covering bike stylesâ??road, mountain, and world-touring modelsâ??along with bike frames and fit, drive trains, wheels, brakes, saddles and handlebars, and accessories, offer up-to-date guidance on the myriad equipment choices from the booming bike industry. And chapters on camping, transporting bikes, and roadside repairs are full of expert advice to help both novice and experienced bike travelers get maximum pleasure from any journey while saving money and staying safe." />
