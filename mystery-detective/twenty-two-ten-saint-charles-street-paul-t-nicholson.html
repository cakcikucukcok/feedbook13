  <title>Twenty-Two Ten Saint Charles Street - Paul T. Nicholson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you believe in witches?  Do you believe in the devil?&lt;br&gt;
We have all been intrigued with the mystery that surrounds witchcraft, the devil and sacrifices.  From as early as the written word Satan has been with us, and the idea of sacrifices has captured the imagination.
&lt;br&gt;
Did you know that there is a private club in Baltimore, Maryland that practices witchcraft, and its members worship Satan?  The club members are doctors, lawyers, judges, and business man and woman who are very wealthy and famous. 
&lt;br&gt;
Twenty-Two Ten Saint Charles Street will take you on a journey through time.  The story interweaves its way through elements of supernatural events and human drama.  Through excerpts from her diary you will come to know Miss Catherine Rhodes, who in 1854 settled in Baltimore to start a business with her brother Alexander.  You will feel in your heart some of the pain and suffering the American people lived through in the years leading up to the Civil War.  You will experience how undivided Baltimore was during this time period, and how a group known as The Baltimore Roughians would roam the streets and question anyone who would gather in groups of two or more.  
&lt;br&gt;
But most of all you will discover a secret that has been hidden behind wooden doors for more than one hundred years.  No one has known about it because the fear that surrounded it still exists today and that secret is The Freedom Crusaders.  You will also find out about the tunnel, and what it meant to the Freedom Crusaders, how they used it, and closed it off, never to be opened again.
&lt;br&gt;
Then, you will travel through time to 1962 and live with Special Forces Sergeant First Class, Thomas Kirkland.  You will experience the new war that the American soldier was unprepared to fight.  The battles, the misery, the friends lost, and the prizes that came from the jungle.
&lt;br&gt;
Sgt. First Class Thomas Kirkland will take you through the streets of Saigon as he learns about Vietnam and its people, and how they suffered for over a century with the French.  In your minds eye you will meet and see Michelle Bovere standing in front of you.  You will feel the pain she and her people lived with, and like the Baltimore Roughians you will discover the Binh Xuyen.  Follow Sgt. Thomas Kirkland through a battle where he loses his friends, and has a rude awakening to what Vietnam was really about.  Watch his life change when he retires and brings home with him the knowledge of Satans Fifth Wave, and the Devil.
&lt;br&gt;
Do you believe in witches?  Do you believe in the devil?
&lt;br&gt;
Ask Phillip Thomas if he 
believes.
&lt;br&gt;
Phillip witnessed something he wasnt supposed to see: he wasnt supposed to be there.  Now hes scared.  Hes got to tell someone.  Who will believe him?  Its too unreal.  In the 1970s you dont have witches and they dont sacrifice babies its too unreal.  How can he prove it?  Who can he tell, who can he trust?  He needs to get proof.  So, he must continue to go down to the club, and continue to see his girlfriends best friend, Marlie.  But not just for sex, this time it will be to get proof.  He remembered seeing a diary that had names in it: Catherine Rhodes, Thomas Kirkland and Samuel Cross, with notes about drugs, prostitution, and kidnapping young children and babies yes, for &lt;i&gt;Sacrifices&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
Phillip witnessed something that he wasnt supposed to, now what will he do?&lt;br&gt;
Twenty-Two Ten Saint Charles Street will take you on a journey through time from 1854 to 1976.  Phillip learns about slavery, the Civil War, Vietnam and witches.  But most of all, Phillip learns about Twenty-Two Saint Charles Street." />
