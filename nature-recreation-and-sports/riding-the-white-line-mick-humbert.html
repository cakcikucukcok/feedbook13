  <title>Riding the White Line - Mick Humbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the third and final book of a trilogy, of sorts, I had in mind some six years ago. In Is Grace Low on the Totem Pole? the most religious topic that has formed the center of my lifes journey will be explored. The bicycle touring material for this book is a ride I began in Alaska, called Homer to Home, which started in June 2014 on my recumbent bicycle that I call Grace. In exploring the religious topic of Grace, this book certainly is the most heady and philosophical that I have written. Hopefully, the bicycling experiences I present will make Grace more understandable and relevant for you. 
If Jesus had been raised in an Inuit culture, I believe he would have understood and spoken in parables about the totem pole. The word Grace that we use so often in Christian tradition seems too mystical and ethereal for general understanding, much less as a practical application upon which to base ones life. I wish to pose and expound on the question: is Grace low on the totem pole? Using material, stories, and personalities from the ride along with the symbolism of the totem pole in the epilogue, I aim to explore a place that Grace can have in ones life." />
