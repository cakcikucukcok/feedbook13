  <title>Tempting The Best Man (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Wild Wedding Nights, Book 2) - Tanya Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A lesson in chemistry…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in college, Mia Hayes had a secret crush on fellow student Daniel Keegan, who was an obnoxious stuffed shirt. But she fantasized about turning Mr. Uptight into Mr. Hot Sex. Now Mia owns a successful event planning business, and at a bachelor party she’s organized, she runs into Mr. Uptight himself. And she&#39;s determined to show overly serious college professor Daniel how to loosen up a little…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine Mia’s surprise when she learns that Daniel has a deliciously wicked side—one that makes her knees weak with lust. It turns out Daniel is a whole lot more than she ever dreamed. But tempting the professor might have been the riskiest thing Mia has ever done. Because in their case, opposites don&#39;t just attract… they combust.&lt;/p&gt;
