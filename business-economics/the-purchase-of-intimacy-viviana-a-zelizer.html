  <title>The Purchase of Intimacy - Viviana A. Zelizer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In their personal lives, people consider it essential to separate economics and intimacy. We have, for example, a long-standing taboo against workplace romance, while we see marital love as different from prostitution because it is not a fundamentally financial exchange. In &lt;i&gt;The Purchase of Intimacy&lt;/i&gt;, Viviana Zelizer mounts a provocative challenge to this view. Getting to the heart of one of life&#39;s greatest taboos, she shows how we all use economic activity to create, maintain, and renegotiate important ties--especially intimate ties--to other people. &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;In everyday life, we invest intense effort and worry to strike the right balance. For example, when a wife&#39;s income equals or surpasses her husband&#39;s, how much more time should the man devote to household chores or child care? Sometimes legal disputes arise. Should the surviving partner in a same-sex relationship have received compensation for a partner&#39;s death as a result of 9/11? &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;Through a host of compelling examples, Zelizer shows us why price is central to three key areas of intimacy: sexually tinged relations; health care by family members, friends, and professionals; and household economics. She draws both on research and materials ranging from reports on compensation to survivors of 9/11 victims to financial management Web sites and advice books for same-sex couples. &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;From the bedroom to the courtroom, &lt;i&gt;The Purchase of Intimacy&lt;/i&gt; opens a fascinating new window on the inner workings of the economic processes that pervade our private lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
