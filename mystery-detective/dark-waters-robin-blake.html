  <title>Dark Waters - Robin Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blake&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Dark Anatomy &lt;/i&gt;has been called &quot;impressive&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) and &quot;a solid winner&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Dark Waters&lt;/i&gt;, the second book in the Cragg &amp; Fidelis series, will leave readers hungry for more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston, 1741. The drowning of drunken publican Antony Egan is no surprise-even if it comes as an unpleasant shock to coroner Titus Cragg, whose wife was the old man&#39;s niece. But he does his duty to the letter, and the inquest&#39;s verdict is accidental death. Meanwhile the town is agog with rumour and faction, as the General Election is only a week away and the two local seats are to be contested by four rival candidates. But Cragg&#39;s close friend, Dr. Luke Fidelis, finds evidence to cast doubt on the events leading to Egan&#39;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon suspicions are further roused when a well-to-do farmer collapses and it appears he was in town on political business. Is there a conspiracy afoot? The Mayor and Council have their own way of imposing order, but Cragg is determined not to be swayed by their pressure. With the help of Fidelis&#39;s scientific ingenuity the true criminals are brought to light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
