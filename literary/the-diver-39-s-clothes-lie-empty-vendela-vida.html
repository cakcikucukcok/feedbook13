  <title>The Diver&#39;s Clothes Lie Empty - Vendela Vida</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lovers&lt;/em&gt; comes a taut, spellbinding literary thriller that probes the essence and malleability of identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vendela Vida&amp;#8217;s taut and mesmerizing novel of ideas, a woman travels to Casablanca, Morocco, on mysterious business. While checking into her hotel, the woman is robbed of her wallet and passport&amp;#8212;all of her money and identification. Though the police investigate, the woman senses an undercurrent of complicity between the hotel staff and the authorities&amp;#8212;she knows she&amp;#8217;ll never recover her possessions. Stripped of her identity, she feels burdened by the crime yet strangely liberated by her sudden freedom to be anyone she chooses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chance encounter with a movie producer leads to a job posing as a stand-in for a well-known film star. The star reels her in deeper, though, and soon she&amp;#8217;s inhabiting the actress&amp;#8217;s skin off set, too&amp;#8212;going deeper into the Casablancan night and further from herself. And so continues a strange and breathtaking journey full of unexpected turns, an adventure in which the woman finds herself moving further and further away from the person she once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with vibrant, lush detail and a wicked sense of humor, &lt;em&gt;The Diver&amp;#8217;s Clothes Lie Empty&lt;/em&gt; is part literary mystery, part psychological thriller&amp;#8212;an unforgettable novel that explores free will, power, and a woman&amp;#8217;s right to choose not her past, perhaps not her present, but certainly her future. This is Vendela Vida&amp;#8217;s most assured and ambitious novel yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
