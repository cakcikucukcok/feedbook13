  <title>The War Bells Have Rung: The LBJ Tapes and the Americanization of the Vietnam War - George C. Herring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson faced an agonizing     decision. On June 7, General William Westmoreland had come to him with a &quot;bombshell&quot; request to     more than double the number of existing troops in Vietnam. LBJ, who wished to be remembered as a     great reformer, not as a war president, saw the proposed escalation for what it was-the turning     point for American involvement in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most discussed     chapters in modern presidential history, but George Herring, the acknowledged dean of Vietnam     War historians, has found a fascinating new way to tell this story-through the remarkable legacy     of LBJ&#39;s taped telephone conversations. Underused until now in exploring Johnson&#39;s     decision making in Vietnam, the phone conversations offer intimate, striking, and sometimes     poignant insights into this ordeal. Johnson emerges as a fascinating character, obligated to     pursue victory in Vietnam but skeptical that it is even possible, the whole while watching his     plans for domestic reform threatened. The president walks a fine line between a military he must     placate and a Congress whose support he must maintain as he tries to implement his Great Society     legislation. The reader can see the flaws in the Cold War sensibility contributing to     Johnson&#39;s tragic attempt to hold ground against an enemy with whom he had no     leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cast includes many of the era&#39;s most iconic players, such     as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Westmoreland (&quot;I have a lot riding on     you,&quot; LBJ tells him-&quot;I hope you don&#39;t pull a MacArthur on me!&quot;), House     minority leader Gerald Ford, anti-war advocate Robert Kennedy (&quot;I think you&#39;ve got to     sit down and talk to Bobby,&quot; LBJ tells McNamara), and former president Eisenhower, a     valuable contact in the Republican camp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A concise, inside look at seven     critical weeks in 1965-presented as a Rotunda ebook linking to transcripts and audio files of     the original presidential tapes- &lt;i&gt;The War Bells Have Rung&lt;/i&gt; offers both student     and scholar a vivid and accessible look at a decision on which LBJ&#39;s presidency would     pivot and that would change modern American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller Center Studies on     the Presidency is a new series of original works that draw on the Miller Center&#39;s scholarly     programs to shed light on the American presidency past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
