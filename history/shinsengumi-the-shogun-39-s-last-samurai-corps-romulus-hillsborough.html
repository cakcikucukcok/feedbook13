  <title>Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s Last Samurai Corps - Romulus Hillsborough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#39;s last Samurai Corps is the true story of the notorious samurai corps formed in 1863 to arrest or kill the enemies of the Tokugawa Shogun.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only book in English about the Shinsengumi, it focuses on the corps&#39; two charismatic leaders, Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo, both impeccable swordsmen. It is a history&amp;#150;in&amp;#150;brief of the final years of the Bakufu, which collapsed in 1867 with the restoration of Imperial rule. In writing Shinsengumi, Hillsborough referred mostly to Japanese&amp;#150;language primary sources, including letters, memoirs, journals, interviews, and eyewitness accounts, as well as definitive biographies and histories of the era.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fall of the shogun&#39;s government (Tokugawa Bakufu, or simply Bakufu) in 1868, which had ruled Japan for over two and a half centuries, was the greatest event in modern Japanese history.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The revolution, known as the Meiji Restoration, began with the violent reaction of samurai to the Bakufu&#39;s decision in 1854 to open the theretofore isolated country to &quot;Western barbarians.&quot; Though opening the country was unavoidable, it was seen as a sign of weakness by the samurai who clamored to &quot;expel the barbarians.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those samurai plotted to overthrow the shogun and restore the holy emperor to his ancient seat of power.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
