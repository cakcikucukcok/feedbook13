  <title>Craig &amp; Fred - Craig Grossi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The uplifting and unforgettable true story of a US Marine, the stray dog he met on an Afghan battlefield, and how they saved each other and now travel America together, &quot;spreading the message of stubborn positivity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Sergeant Craig Grossi was doing intelligence work for Marine RECON&amp;#8212;the most elite fighters in the Corps&amp;#8212;in a remote part of Afghanistan. While on patrol, he spotted a young dog &quot;with a big goofy head and little legs&quot; who didn&amp;#8217;t seem vicious or run in a pack like most strays they&amp;#8217;d encountered. After eating a piece of beef jerky Craig offered&amp;#8212;against military regulations&amp;#8212;the dog began to follow him. &quot;Looks like you made a friend,&quot; another Marine yelled. Grossi heard, &quot;Looks like a &#39;Fred.&#39;&quot; The name stuck, and a beautiful, life-changing friendship was forged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred not only stole Craig&amp;#8217;s heart; he won over the RECON fighters, who helped Craig smuggle the dog into heavily fortified Camp Leatherneck in a duffel bag&amp;#8212;risking jail and Fred&amp;#8217;s life. With the help of a crew of DHL workers, a sympathetic vet, and a military dog handler, Fred eventually made it to Craig&amp;#8217;s family in Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, when Craig returned to the U.S., it was Fred&amp;#8217;s turn to save the wounded Marine from Post-Traumatic Stress. Today, Craig and Fred are touching lives nationwide, from a swampy campground in a Louisiana State Park to the streets of Portland, Oregon, and everywhere in between. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poignant and inspiring tale of hope, resilience, and optimism, with a timeless message at its heart&amp;#8212;&quot;it is not what happens to us that matters, but how we respond to it&quot;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Craig&amp;#160;&amp;#38; Fred&lt;/em&gt; is a shining example of the power of love to transform our hearts and our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
