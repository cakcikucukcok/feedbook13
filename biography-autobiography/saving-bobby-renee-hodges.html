  <title>Saving Bobby - Renee Hodges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Renee Hodges invited her nephew, Bobby, to come stay with her for a few weeks so he could visit a doctor about his back pain, she knew he was recovering from an addiction to prescription painkillers. She believed that if he could address his back problems, he would have a better chance of staying clean—but she had no idea what a roller coaster ride she was getting on. 
Unlike other books about addiction, &lt;em&gt;Saving Bobby&lt;/em&gt; begins  &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; rehab is over. Told in part through journal entries, e-mails, and personal recollections, this raw, honest, deeply moving memoir—begun to keep the family accountable—describes the sixteen months that Hodges, her husband, and their community struggled alongside Bobby as he attempted to successfully re-enter the day-to-day world. Using a holistic and open approach, the shame and stigma associated with addiction was lessened—and ultimately, Bobby learned he had to save himself.  
A gripping and heartrending story of survival, &lt;em&gt;Saving Bobby&lt;/em&gt; is an essential, timely read for those concerned about America’s most pressing epidemic." />
