  <title>The Janitor Solves a Murder - Paul Daffinrud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A young Milrose State college student goes out early one morning to prepare for his first bicycle race and is abruptly sidetracked when he discovers the body of a young woman, sadistically murdered and nailed to the wall of a pavilion. There had never been a murder in this small Minnesota town and now the first one for the records is a crucifixion.&lt;p&gt; 
Recently appointed to detective status, Sally Fairfield receives a phone call from Detective Bob Carpenter of the Milrose Police Department and reports to the scene of her first homicide investigation with a hangover. Assigned to investigate the case, the two detectives quickly realize theyre in over their heads. Carpenter, a law enforcement officer for over twenty years, has never worked a murder case. With more than one suspect in the small town, they opt to call their friend, Josh Trimble, from the Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension.&lt;p&gt; 
An arrest is made, but is this person the murderer? The three detectives have some doubts, but the inexperienced county attorney insists on an indictment. While the detectives review the clues, a trial takes place, and with lives at stake, revelations after the trial break the case wide open in &lt;i&gt;The Janitor Solves a Murder&lt;/i&gt;." />
