  <title>Ibos of Nigeria and Their Cultural Ways - Columbus Okoroike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is about the Ibos of southeastern Nigeria, whose language is Igbo. This very uniquely distinct ethnic group of people have been accused of being tenacious in their belief, audacious in their venture, intense in their resistance and unrelenting in their persistence.&lt;p&gt;
The book is aimed at creating awareness and a more comfortable feeling toward Igbo speaking people and their culture. It is a culture that must not be forgotten, a heritage that is gradually being lost in our over-excitement and eagerness to Europeanize. The conventionalized Igbo signs, gestures, the admissible expressions, idioms, folk-tales, folk-songs, vocabulary and phraseology, truly have no close substitutes in English language. A culture that thrives on self-reliance, equality, democracy and healthy competition.&lt;p&gt;
You are invited to read and know a people obsessed with the desire for self-improvement through education and learning, who also are open to new ideas and easily adaptable to change. The book is a first of its kind by an Ibo man who sees the urgent and pressing need to preserve the Igbo language, traditions and cultural heritage, so that our children and future generations of Ibos and Ibo lovers will be educated and passed on the Igbo diction and the people&#39;s source of strength and power. It will also prepare anyone on what to expect, going, meeting and doing business with the people, as it answers basic questions and clears misconceptions." />
