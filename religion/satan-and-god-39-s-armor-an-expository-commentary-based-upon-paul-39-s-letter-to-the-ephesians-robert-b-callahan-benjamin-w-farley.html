  <title>Satan and God&#39;s Armor: An Expository Commentary Based upon Paul&#39;s Letter to the Ephesians - Robert B. Callahan, Benjamin W. Farley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul leaves no stone unturned as he encourages, enlightens, and informs the Ephesian believers (and us) regarding their duties and responsibilities as Christ&#39;s followers. Yes, there are duties and responsibilities for professing Christians, just as there are duties and responsibilities in every phase of life whether it be as children/parents; employee/employer; student/teacher; or whatever field of endeavor one may pursue.   The apostle is addressing those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and seek to follow Him, which as Paul knows is not easy. Therefore, in this portion of Scripture he stresses certain truths that will strengthen each and every Christian as they journey through life. The elements may sound simple to learn, but they are difficult to practice day in and day out. What are they? Obedience, discipline, priorities, knowing your heavenly Father (not just knowing about Him), being strong disciples in the faith, and separating ourselves. Developing these traits requires a commitment to adhere to Christ&#39;s teachings and commands.   Paul then switches our attention from what we are to do as Christ&#39;s followers and states emphatically that we are to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles [schemes] of the devil (Eph 6:1-11). Paul states unequivocally that we are to prepare to wrestle this implacable foe, since we belong to Christ and are His followers. He describes Satan, his evil characteristics and malevolent intentions. Christ recognized him for what he is. Should we do less? Unfortunately, in today&#39;s world we ignore him and fail to realize the harm he inflicts on ourselves and others.  Paul concludes this portion of Scripture on a high note. He urges us to be properly prepared; to recognize heresies; to watch and pray; to know the difference between false and true teachings; and to know the Lord Jesus Christ and what He experienced during His earthly ministry." />
