She knows what could happen if she disobeys her father. The king has put nobler women to death for lesser trespasses. But she was promised to Curan first, and his kisses are very tempting.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Novels of Mary Wine&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;.  .  .delightful characters and a charming romance.  .  .definitely a must-read.&quot;  --Heather Graham on &lt;i&gt;In Bed with a Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A bold and lusty hero, a brave heroine, and intrigue at the royal court of Scotland.  .  .sexy and exciting as the Highland hills themselves!&quot;  --Elizabeth Hoyt on &lt;i&gt;In the Warrior&#39;s Bed&lt;/i&gt;" />
