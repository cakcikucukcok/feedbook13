  <title>Inspired Wisdom for Progressive Living - Pastor Stephen Kyeyune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written from the biblical perspective because humans are, as Christianity teaches, inherently religious creatures, born with a sense of the supernatural. Therefore, in order for the message to edify, it must be inspired.
This book contains quotations of wisdom. Wisdom is not an option. Wisdom involves making decisions. The decisions you make will either make you or break you. Wisdom eludes the proud who refuses to humble themselves and seek God. If you want God to lead, you must be willing to follow him.
When you read this book, you will get a piece of pie sliced from our cultural values. I have included some proverbs from our tribes. We cannot ignore the role of our cultures in shaping our societies. But our cultures are not absolute. God instituted the church as the point of reference.
Unless you understand the Lordship of Jesus Christ and the government of the Holy Spirit, you and I cannot be agents of change. When you open up to learning, the Lord will take you through deep waters, and it is in the deep that we find the treasures of the Lord (Isa. 45:3). As they say, if you need gold, you have to dig deep, but you dont need to toil to get clay.
Allow me to take you step by step through my devotional journal. Apply the acquired wisdom to your daily living." />
