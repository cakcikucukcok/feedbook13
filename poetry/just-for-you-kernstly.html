 Patrice Kernstly Datus
My dear friend,
Reading those wonderful poems will put you in a place of mind that requires your attention. These poems will make you think over and over again about life, your connection with God, and most of all about love. Your spiritual mind will grow, and your faith will make you see life differently. You will start feeling hope like never before. And you will enjoy life every day as if it were your last day on earth. They will give you advice on relations, on how to love and to let go of those who are put in your path to give you experience. You will learn how to differ the right one for you from those who are temporary. And for those of you who are single, you will be advised to not let your love fade away. And if it is your choice, then use this gift to do Gods work. 
I hope that by reading these poems, you learn one or two things about life. I wish you good luck on your daily life activities, and may life be filled with happiness every day.
 Sincerely yours,
Patrice Kernstly Datus" />
