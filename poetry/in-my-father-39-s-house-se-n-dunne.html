  <title>In My Father&#39;s House - Seán Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seán Dunne&#39;s mother died at the age of thirty-three, when he was four years old. In My Father&#39;s House, his account of the trials and tests of a childhood in Waterford in the 1960s, touched a communal heart when it was published in 1991, and became a bestseller. This eloquent testimony to one fractured family&#39;s capacity to prevail, including the heroic roles enacted by Seán&#39;s father, Richie, and their housekeeper, Tessie, unfolds with an understated dignity. Acute loss and vivid recall yield wry and poignant truths. Seán Dunne&#39;s disarmingly simply prose scrutinizes social history in an Irish housing-estate, with its stories of tragedy and resilience, through the lens of personal experience. Told with honesty, humour and love, it endures also as the record of a spiritual odyssey and growth." />
