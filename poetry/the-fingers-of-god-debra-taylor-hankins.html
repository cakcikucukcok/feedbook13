  <title>The Fingers of God - Debra Taylor Hankins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thank God whos the head of my life I thank Him for allowing me to serve
Him in mind body and spirit, I thank God for I know I have been chosen. We do a work for God and to be a part of His Marvelous Plan thanking God for the grace He bestowed upon my life from the beginning up to thus far. I would like to share as a testimony how the number 5 represents grace and how it is and has always been a part of my life; I was born in 1956 (1+9=10) (5+6=11) carry the 1 over to me being the first baby born at Receiving Hospital in 56. I was the 5th child born to Leon and Rosemary Taylor. 
		God saved me sanctified and filled me with the Holy Ghost at the age of 14 (1+4=5). I backslid and God let me wonder in the world for 32 (3+2=5) years. But even in my sin God watches over me within that time span not just because it was part of my purpose but all part of Gods Plan. I gave birth to 5 children in all. In 1996 (1+9=10) (9+6=15) then God blessed me with a factory job at the age of 40 and it lasted 6 years (6+4=10). In the 5th month on the 5th day I made a vow to the Lord that I would serve Him until the day I die. God reclaimed me my husband Clarence and we were baptized in 2010. We have been together 28 years (2+8=10) years. As you come to the end of my testimony its not just a story see how God is blessing all over the place. This is how I know that I have been chosen handpicked by God and yes Im full of grace!!! I LOVE EVERYONE!!! GOD BLESS!!!!" />
