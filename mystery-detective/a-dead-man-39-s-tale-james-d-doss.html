      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlie Moon, Ute rancher and investigator, isn&#39;t afraid to throw the dice even when a man&#39;s life is at stake, but when that man is betting against himself and Moon&#39;s ability to save him, that makes for some awfully high stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard times have come to Colorado, and Moon&#39;s ranch is feeling the pinch. Investor Samuel Reed has never had that problem. He seems to have a special intuition when it comes to picking stocks and claims to be able to remember the future, which gives him quite a leg up on Wall Street. So it&#39;s no surprise that Reed is confident when he makes a wager with Moon&#39;s best friend, Granite City Chief of Police Scott Parish, that Parish can&#39;t keep him alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when Reed doesn&#39;t give them any details beyond the date and time of his impending demise, that&#39;s more than enough information for Moon who wants in on the action and is just as confident that he&#39;s well on the way to saving his ranch. But Moon&#39;s best plans go awry when instead of one homicide on his hands, he ends up with two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James D.
