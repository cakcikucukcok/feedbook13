  <title>Crime Real Estate - Shanna Carrigan-Preikschat, Duane Goins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victoria is on her way to show a house to a really nice couple. Just the day before, she was at her sister Janets house, and wow! What a story Janet had for her about witnessing a murder in her own workplace. She is so glad nothing like that ever happens in her small town. One thing is for sure, she knows just what goes on in Lindenwood, Illinois. She works as a dispatcher for the police department. One day, though, her real estate career will finally come through for her, and she can quit the police department once and for all and work at something she knows she will enjoy doing. That is until she starts to show the house to Stacy and Dale and find a body inside it. To make matters worse, that lunatic cop she works with is the first one to show up. Thankfully, the detective handling the case knows what hes doing, but Victoria is unaware of the dangers that face her as this case goes on. Read as Victorias mundane life takes on unwanted excitement." />
