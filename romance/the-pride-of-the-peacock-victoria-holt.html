      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;A young woman uncovers her family&#39;s dark secrets in this mystery and her connection to a famously cursed gemstone in this Victorian gothic thriller from an internationally bestselling author&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure her inheritance, &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Clavering&lt;/strong&gt; agrees to a marriage of convenience, but will her handsome new husband&#39;s desire for her ever surpass his obsession with a famously cursed opal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised in the shadow of her family&#39;s financial ruin, Jessica has never felt as though she fit in. When her only friend, an elderly neighbor, offers her the chance at a new life, she&#39;s eager to take it. His only condition: she must marry her son, &lt;strong&gt;Joss&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newlyweds inherit a fabled opal mine in Australia. It&#39;s only once they arrive on the faraway continent that Jessica starts to uncover her family&#39;s dark past and her connection to the Green Flash, an exquisite and spellbinding opal. &lt;strong&gt;The stone arouses a dangerous desire in anyone who sees it&lt;/strong&gt;-even her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blending historical romance with elements of the paranormal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Pride of the Peacock &lt;/em&gt;is an exhilarating tale from the Queen of Gothic Romance.
