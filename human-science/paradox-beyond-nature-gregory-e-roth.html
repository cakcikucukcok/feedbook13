  <title>Paradox Beyond Nature - Gregory E. Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Germanos is a source of Mariological reflection for both Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. Yet paradoxically the two great Marian churches find it difficult to understands each others Mariology. Germanos homilies provide a common ground on which Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christians can meet. 
 Chapters include: Introduction, the life of Germanos, Byzantine rhetorical education, difficulties in understanding eighth-century Byzantine homilies and their use of rhetoric, Orthodox theology and philosophy, introduction to the homilies, a close translation and commentary on each homily from the Greek text. These commentaries include comments drawn from five separate commentators. Additionally there are fourteen commentaries on various themes in the homilies. Finally, a comparison is made employing an article by Tibor Horvath, S.J, and a dissertation by p.Erasmo Perniola with comments from this author in an attempt to establish an example of a mutually constructive conversation.  This is done in the hope of establishing a renewed dialogue between these two great and deep Mariological traditions." />
