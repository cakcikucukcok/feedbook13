        &lt;p&gt;MISS MAPLE AND THE PLAYBOY&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Primary-school teacher Beth Maple is cautious and conventional until she becomes besotted with stand-in dad Ben Anderson, who appears at the school gates. Being around him makes her feel truly alive. But Ben is dangerously out of her league!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE PLAYBOY DOCTOR’S MARRIAGE PROPOSAL&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Emily Tippett is not what doctor Linton Gregory needs. An expert at protecting his own heart, he prefers to date and move on. But Linton has seen the beauty Emily is trying to hide. He’s ready to go from playboy doctor to husband-to-be, but is Emily interested?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE NEW GIRL IN TOWN&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Photographer Zoe Kozlowski is transforming her new home into a bed and breakfast. Luckily for her, architect – and eligible bachelor – Mason Sullivan is there to help. Except Mason’s interests are more than just professional…&lt;/p&gt;
