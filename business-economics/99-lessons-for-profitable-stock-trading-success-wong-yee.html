  <title>99 Lessons for Profitable Stock Trading Success - Wong Yee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dare to venture into the stock market? In a surging bull market, it is not a professional game. Share prices are rising so fast that practically everybody makes money. However, in a bear market, it is indeed a professional game &amp;mdash; a case of the big investors winning at the expense of the small retail players. Thus, when the bull market ends, losses are inevitable. It&amp;#39;s too late, all is lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A profitable stock trader is one who can make money in both bull and bear markets. In the bear market, when no one is buying, he is doing bargain hunting and he gets ready to sell his shares when the market is bullish. In the bullish market, he knows how to ride the bull trend and sell off ahead of others and not to get greedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book teaches you practical lessons on stock investing and how not to make the same mistakes that 90% of investors made. I sincerely hope that readers will be enriched and enlightened in one way or another in their pursuit of becoming a profitable stock trader." />
