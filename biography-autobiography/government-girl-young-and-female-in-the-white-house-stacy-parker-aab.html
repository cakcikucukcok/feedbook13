  <title>Government Girl: Young and Female in the White House - Stacy Parker Aab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A delightful page-turner&amp;#8230;that will put the lucky reader within the feverish excitement of a hopeful and tragic time.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8212;Andrei Codrescu, NPR commentator and author of The Posthuman Dada Guide: Tzara and Lenin Play Chess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A memoir of being young and female in the Clinton White House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stacy Parker Aab was born in Detroit in 1974, the only daughter of a white Kansas farm girl and a young black Detroiter fresh from two tours of Vietnam. An excellent student, Aab gravitated toward public service and moved to Washington, D.C., for college in the hopeful days of 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only would Aab study political communication at The George Washington University, but she would also intern at the White House. For three years, she worked for George Stephanopoulos. In 1997 she became White House staff, serving as Paul Begala&#39;s special assistant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, life was charmed, with nurturing mentors, superstar politicos, and handsome Secret Service agents. In January 1998, the world of the Clinton White House changed radically. Monica Lewinsky became a household name, and Aab learned quickly that in Washington, protectors can become predators, investigators will chase you like prey, and if you make mistakes with a powerful man, the world will turn your name into mud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government Girl&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a window into the culture of the Clinton White House, as seen through the eyes of an idealistic young female aide. Stacy Parker Aab&#39;s intimate memoir tells of her coming-of-age in the lion&#39;s den. Her story provides a searing look at the dynamics between smart young women and the influential older men who often hold the keys to their dreams." />
