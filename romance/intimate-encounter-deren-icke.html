  <title>Intimate Encounter - Deren Icke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jeff, a lost soul and former playboy turned journalist married to a good woman, is having issues in his marriage. His friend from an immoral past takes him to a unique resort for the night of his life. This opens the doorway to a dark world of lust, power, murder, kidnap, bullying, abuse and blackmail. He finds himself too deeply involved to quit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A girl&amp;nbsp;lost from birth and at the mercy of a selfish society&amp;nbsp;is trapped in an underground world of human trafficking. She wonders what true love would be like since all the men she meets have only one dark motive in mind. This is until she meets Jeff. Her first love is a married man who is trying to set her free from her captors, one of whom has fallen in love with her, a man named Robert, cursed from birth with ugliness and hiding from the law and some very bad people whose friend he murdered years back. Jeff needs his help. can he trust a jealous murderer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then comes the ghetto gang who believe it is their right to be rich. Only they don&amp;#39;t plan to earn it. They succeed in carrying out the biggest robbery ever known in the ghetto. Their hopes of a life of riches is dashed when one of their own&amp;nbsp;stabs them in the back and disappears. But a fugitive cannot stay away from true love forever. He returns to claim his queen, or so it seems. His friends turned enemies are waiting and crying for his blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a story of the best and worst of humanity. Everybody yearns for love. Everybody also yearns for a life of comfort. The two primary needs clash again and again. Some sacrifice wealth for love. Others trample on loved ones for riches. The only thing certain in this ever twisting tale of love and lust is that no one stays the same when faced with circumstances that threaten their very lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end Jeff finds his place in life&amp;nbsp;but at the cost of everyone he ever loved. He finds himself in possession of information so sensitive that any who knows he has it would kill to take it from him, information that has been used to blackmail and enslave the rich and mighty of society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
