  <title>Lost Legacy - Jim Schneider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emil Pulaski, private investigator and former FBI agent, is hired by the Salash Tribe of Indians to find a stolen will. At stake, is the large and very valuable Bradford ranch adjoining their reservation. It had been left to the tribe by the owner, William Bradford, in a 1905 will that disappeared in 1909 when he was found dead under mysterious circumstances. The will reappears briefly in 1990&#39;s after it was found by Leela Thayer, a local artist, only to be stolen by a tribal member in an attempt to extort money from one of the Bradford heirs. The thief ends up murdered, and Emil teams up with Leela Thayer to recover the will. The Bradford heir turns out to have connections with a major crime family in Los Angeles and calls for help with devastating results. More murders, mayhem, and a bomb explosion that almost costs Emil his life, soon follow and the small city of Coeur d&#39;Alene flows with the blood of the innocent." />
