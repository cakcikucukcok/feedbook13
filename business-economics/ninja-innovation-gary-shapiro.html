  <title>Ninja Innovation - Gary Shapiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Innovate or die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For thirty years, Gary Shapiro has observed the world&#39;s most innovative businesses from his front-row seat as leader of the Consumer Electronics Association. Now he reveals the ten secrets of &quot;ninja innovators&quot; like Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to succeed? Discipline. Mission-oriented strategy. Adaptability. Decisiveness. And a will for victory. In short, today&#39;s most successful businesses are &quot;ninja innovators.&quot; Drawn from Gary Shapiro&#39;s three decades of experience leading the consumer electronics industry, &lt;em&gt;Ninja Innovation&lt;/em&gt; takes readers behind the scenes of today&#39;s top enterprises, uncovering their ten essential strategies for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As head of the Consumer Electronics Association and its influential annual trade show, the International CES, Shapiro has worked with the most innovative companies in history&amp;#8212;Intel, IBM, and Samsung, to name a few&amp;#8212;focusing on creating policies and events that produce revolutionary products year after year. He has learned the key strategies that have guided these businesses to record-breaking profits, as well as the traps that have led so many others to crushing failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to stay in front of the pace of innovation, Shapiro observes, top companies must  operate as an elite strike force&amp;#8212;just like the legendary medieval warriors known as ninjas. Ninjas weren&#39;t called upon to do the ordinary; they had to perform truly extraordinary tasks, while risking everything. As a highly trained martial-arts black belt himself, Shapiro mines the valuable insights of these centuries-old warriors to spotlight the secrets of agility, creativity, decisiveness, and reinvention that are essential for twenty-first-century leaders seeking breakthrough success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking readers inside the most cutting-edge businesses, &lt;em&gt;Ninja Innovation&lt;/em&gt; is the ultimate guide to achieving victory in today&#39;s innovate-or-die economy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
