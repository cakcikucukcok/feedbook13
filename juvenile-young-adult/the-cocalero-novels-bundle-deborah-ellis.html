His parents farmed coca, a traditional Bolivian medicinal plant, until they got caught in the middle of the government&#39;s war on drugs and were mistakenly convicted of drug possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diego&#39;s parents are locked up, but he can come and go: to school, to the market to sell his mother&#39;s handknitted goods, and to work as a &quot;taxi,&quot; running errands for other prisoners. But then his little sister temporarily runs off while under his watch, earning his mother a heavy fine. The debt and dawning realization of his hopeless situation make him vulnerable to his friend Mando&#39;s plan to make big money, fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Diego is deep in the jungle, working as a virtual slave in an illegal cocaine operation. As his situation becomes more and more dangerous, he knows he must take a terrible risk if he ever wants to see his family again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sacred Leaf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he finally manages to escape from being a virtual slave in an illegal cocaine operation, Diego is taken in by the Ricardo family &amp;#8212; poor coca farmers who provide a safe haven while he recovers from his ordeal in the jungle. But even that brief respite comes to an end when the army moves in and destroys the family&#39;s coca crop &amp;#8212; and their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diego eventually joins the cocaleros as they protest the destruction of their crops by barricading the roads, confronting the army head on. As tension between the cocaleros builds to a dramatic standoff, the wonders whether he will ever find a way to return to his family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
