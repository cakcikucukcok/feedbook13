  <title>The Reunion - Michael James Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ocean&#39;s Harbor, Maine, is the paragon of a beautiful coastal New England enclave; a community with families rooted as deep as the sins, where dark secrets simmer beneath its vestal faade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
It&#39;s here that Stone Grey, a novelist, returns for his twentieth high-school reunion, hoping to put behind him his tumultuous youthful memories and somehow find comfort in the aftermath of his brother&#39;s death. But that&#39;s far from what he finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Stone unwittingly happens upon a thirty-year-old murder mystery, and is stunned to discover that his family is entwined in its web of intrigue and danger. As Stone tries to uncover the truth and clear his family&#39;s name, he stumbles over the town&#39;s darkest secret and soon learns that this haunting mystery is bound tightly to the town&#39;s other families. With the town&#39;s families closing in around him, Stone suddenly realizes that his crusade for justice may cost him his life." />
