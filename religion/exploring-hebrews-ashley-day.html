  <title>Exploring Hebrews - Ashley Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nobody knows for certain who wrote the letter to the Hebrews. Many scholars (such as Arthur Pink and the early Catholics) believe Paul was the author. Others claim it was written by Timothy or Barnabas. Some even suggest that the writers were Aquila and Priscilla. Still others (such as Martin Luther and R.C. Lenski) believe that Apollos wrote it. But despite the learned theories, which claim to prove the authors identity, none succeeds, and the fact remains that despite two thousand years of scholarship, nobody knows who actually penned these immortal words.
Even if we knew the authors identity, the knowledge would not help us very much. It would not change one word of the letter, nor make it more effective. Exploring Hebrews does not waste time following rabbit trails, but instead concentrates on what the letter itself has to say. Every verse is covered and carefully explained. Our goal is to learn, bearing in mind that although God has not revealed the identity of the human author of Hebrews, the letter was clearly written under divine inspiration. All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16) and The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21)." />
