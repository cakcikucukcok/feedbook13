  <title>Forbidden Ground - Karen Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Let the dead stay dead&amp;#133;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Despite a traumatic childhood in Cold Creek, Ohio, the Lockwood sisters have reunited there for the wedding of youngest sister Tess to the town&#39;s sheriff. Maid of honor Kate Lockwood is determined to break through best man Grant Mason&#39;s defences. An anthropologist, Kate makes her living studying the dead. She is particularly interested in the prehistoric Adena civilization that once called the area home. A large burial mound sits on Mason family land, and Kate wants permission to excavate. But Grant refuses and tells Kate to stay away from the mound.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Kate respects Grant&#39;s desire to honor his grandfather&#39;s belief that the dead should not be disturbed. However, the more she researches the more it becomes clear that Grant is hiding something. When one of Grant&#39;s friends is killed&amp;#151;and the sheriff is away on his honeymoon&amp;#151;the couple joins forces to assist the deputy in the investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When Kate comes under attack she is certain it is connected to the burial mound. Grant seems concerned for Kate&#39;s safety, but despite their explosive attraction she can&#39;t help but be suspicious of his motives. Can Kate trust the man she&#39;s come to love, or will the wrong decision be her final act?" />
