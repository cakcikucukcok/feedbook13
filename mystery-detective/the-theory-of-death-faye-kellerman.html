  <title>The Theory of Death - Faye Kellerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now living in upstate New York, former LAPD lieutenant Peter Decker is plunged into a bizarre web involving academia, underworld crime, and calculating killers in this compulsive novel in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Faye Kellerman&amp;#39;s beloved Decker and Lazarus series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former LAPD lieutenant Peter Decker is relishing the quiet and slow pace of his new job with the Greenbury police department. The work is low stress and engaging, and it&amp;#8217;s been almost a year since the last murder in this sleepy upstate New York town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the body of a nude man is found deep within the woods, shattering Decker&amp;#8217;s peace. The death appears to be a suicide&amp;#8212;a single shot to the head, the gun by his side. But until the coroner&amp;#8217;s ruling, the scene must be treated as a suspicious crime. Without any personal effects near the body, Decker must dig to uncover his identity, a task made difficult by the department&amp;#8217;s tight budget and limited personnel. Luckily, Decker gets some unexpected help when his friend and former Greenbury colleague Tyler McAdams calls, looking for a quiet place to study for his law finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation takes Decker and McAdams to Kneed Loft College, where they must penetrate the indecipherable upper echelons of mathematics and mathematical prodigies. Beneath the school&amp;#8217;s rarified atmosphere they discover a sphere of scheming academics, hidden cyphers&amp;#8212;and most dangerous of all&amp;#8212;a realm of underworld crime that transforms harmless nerds into cold, calculating evil geniuses. It will take all of Decker&amp;#8217;s experience and McAdams&amp;#8217;s brains to penetrate enigmatic formulas and codes and solve a dark, twisted crime devised by some brilliant and depraved masterminds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
