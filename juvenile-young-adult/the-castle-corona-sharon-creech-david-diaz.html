  <title>The Castle Corona - Sharon Creech, David Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Long ago and far away . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a castle. But not just any castle. This was a castle that glittered and sparkled and rose majestically above the banks of the winding Winono River: the Castle Corona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in this castle lived a family. But not just any family. This was the family of King Guido: rich and royal and . . . spoiled. And King Guido was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; spoiled that neither jewels nor gold nor splendid finery could please him, for what he longed for most was . . . a nap and a gown that didn&#39;t itch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far below this grand, glittering castle lived two peasants. But not just any peasants. These peasants, though poor and pitiful, were plucky and proud. And in possession of a stolen pouch. But not just any pouch. A pouch whose very contents had the power to unlock secrets and transform lives . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And oh, there is an author. But not just any author. Sharon Creech is a Newbery Medal-winning author whose tantalizing tale will not only dazzle and delight but also entertain and excite.&lt;/p&gt;" />
