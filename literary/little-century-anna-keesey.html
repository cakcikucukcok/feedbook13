  <title>Little Century - Anna Keesey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of such classics as &lt;i&gt;My ﾃ］tonia &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/i&gt;, Anna Keesey&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Little Century &lt;/i&gt;is a resonant and moving debut novel by a writer of confident gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orphaned after the death of her mother, eighteen-year-old Esther Chambers heads west in search of her only living relative. In the lawless frontier town of Century, Oregon, she&#39;s met by her distant cousin, a laconic cattle rancher named Ferris Pickett. Pick leads her to a tiny cabin by a small lake called Half-a-Mind, and there she begins her new life as a homesteader. If she can hold out for five years, the land will join Pick&#39;s already impressive spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Esther discovers that this town on the edge of civilization is in the midst of a range war. There&#39;s plenty of land, but somehow it is not enough for the ranchers--it&#39;s cattle against sheep, with water at a premium. In this charged climate, small incidents of violence swiftly escalate, and Esther finds her sympathies divided between her cousin and a sheepherder named Ben Cruff, a sworn enemy of the cattle ranchers. As her feelings for Ben and for her land grow, she begins to see she can&#39;t be loyal to both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Century &lt;/i&gt;maps our country&#39;s cutthroat legacy of dispossession and greed, even as it celebrates the ecstatic visions of what America could become.&lt;/p&gt;" />
