  <title>Rogues, Riches &amp; Retribution - Harry Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Toni Virenti and his twin Italian brother witness
the death of their father. Family mafia elders decide that
one day they will avenge their fathers death.
In Tonis quest for revenge, he meets and falls in
love with the adopted daughter of the lawyer who killed his 
father. Her relationship with her father is at breaking
point and, when she discovers a treacherous deed 
by him towards her, she makes a solemn promise that one 
day he will regret what he has done.
Under cover of his business the lawyer administers 
deals for the underworld. He hires Virenti 
to undertake a mission with a wealthy Arab. Virenti engages in  
double dealing, leaving the Arab to believe the lawyer 
is responsible and seek revenge.
Three people with one objective, one cause, choose to
carry out their task on the day the lawyer hosts an elaborate
garden party in the grounds of his home.
