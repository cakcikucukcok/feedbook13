  <title>The Pencil Man - Don McAllister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I LOVED the book! I laughed, I cried and couldn&#39;t wait to finish it and at the same time saved the last 10 pages for 2 days because I didn&#39;t want it to end! THANK YOU DON. It was great! I will recommend to all my friends!
These characters are so real.  Are you sure this is fiction? 
These are some of the reader reactions to Don McAllisters first novel Angel and the Ivory Tower.
The same vivid imagery and cant wait to read whats next style of writing can be found in this work The Pencil Man, Dons second novel.
The Pencil Man was a real person who lived in Anderson, Indiana during the 1950s. He was a beggar who had no legs, moved about on a board with wheels, and sold pencils on the street. Many remember him, but no one seems to know who he was or what became of him.
While no one knows the real story of the Pencil Man, this novel tries to give some idea of what it would be like to be The Pencil Man.
The story includes the mystical realm of the spirits, experiences, and decisions that guide everyones fate. It also places one in the position of The Pencil Man himself, and shows us the world from a very different perspective.
As with Angel and the Ivory Tower, you will be entertained, laugh, and cry, but more importantly your eyes will be opened to people around you who may now seem invisible." />
