In a phenomenal feat of political organizing, Kovic corralled his fellow AVM members into staging a sit-in, and then a hunger strike, in the Los Angeles office of Senator Alan Cranston, demanding better treatment of injured and disabled veterans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This was a short-lived and chaotic but ultimately successful movement to improve the deplorable conditions in VA hospitals across the country. &lt;I&gt;Hurricane Street&lt;/I&gt; is their story--one that resonates deeply today--told by Kovic in the passionate and brutally honest style that led to over one million sales of &lt;I&gt;Born on the Fourth of July&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
