  <title>Tricky Ricky: The Homestead Twins (Part 1) - Jannis Hibberts, Marina Calin, Judy Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the Homestead, and the first in a series of stories featuring the twins, Richard and Rachel, who live there with their parents, Mama and Papa, in the fertile and beautiful Pacific Northwest of the United States. The twins are home schooled. They help their parents cultivate and care for their little farm so it produces most of the food the family needs, all year round. When they&#39;re not studying or helping with the homestead, the twins have many adventures in which they invite you to join them, like the one described in this book. Here&#39;s a little taste of it:     Oh how excited the twins were. They couldn&#39;t wait to get started. It was their very first time ever to row the rowboat. And they were going to help row all the way over to the north shore of Five Acre Pond. What a great adventure this was going to be.   Papa gently pushed the rowboat out into the water and grabbing his own paddle, jumped onto his seat. Papa started whistling &quot;Row your boat&quot; and everybody joined in song.   The family continued to row. About half way across the water Mama said &quot;Uh oh&quot;...&quot;it looks like we might get a little wet, those dark clouds have moved close enough overhead to drop some of its bounty on us&quot; and sure enough, no sooner than she finished her warning, drops started hitting the calm surface of the water and their heads." />
