      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Professional bull rider Colt McCade isn&#39;t a good guy, but he&#39;ll do anything for his sister--including rescuing her normally straitlaced best friend after she gets into trouble at a bar while in his city.

How can he say no? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kindergarten teacher Jenna Justice has lived her life by the book--right school, right career, right image. Too bad the townsfolk of Diamond, Kansas have a hard time forgetting that she wasn&#39;t born on the right side of the tracks. The only way JJ can land her dream job is to keep her wild side buried and her reputation clean.

Because the sexy bad boy wants more than just one night, which is exactly what she can&#39;t give...no matter how much she wants to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Chasing Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Trouble&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Temptation&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Desire&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Mr. Wrong&lt;/p&gt;" />
