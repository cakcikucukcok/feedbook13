  <title>Treasures of My Mind - Keith Simmonds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the age of self-expression, thanks to the multiplicity
of social media. Self-publishing is what I would refer to
as the high end of social media where persons like myself
can express our thoughts with meaning and freedom.
We dont have to wait on the high gods of the publishing
world to give us the rights of publication. 
I wanted to step outside of my world of political science and
publish my thoughts on a variety of topics, most of which
have no relation to politics. I wanted to share my thoughts
with a wider community of readers and so I decided to
share my long-held beliefs about self-improvement, society,
love, forgiveness and a host of other topics. 
Some will be readily accepted, perhaps, while others
will cause some to wonder if they can buy that idea.
Yet, other ideas may not be accepted as good ideas
at all. Thats okay. One of the goals of the book is to
stimulate thought, and develop an ongoing conversation
on thoughts Ive expressed in the book.
Please read and ponder the meaning of each thought
and feel free to share your own thoughts with me about
any that triggers interest or disagreement. Im still on the
learning curve of life and can learn from my readers as well.
I can be reached at kcsimms@gmail.com. Each email
will be given full attention in my answer." />
