  <title>American Spirit - Taya Kyle, Jim Defelice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &quot;American Sniper&quot; legacy continues: Taya Kyle celebrates&amp;#160;the American Spirit in her inspiring new book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life leads us through difficult terrain. But what happens&amp;#160;if you&amp;#160;use challenge as an opportunity to discover your PURPOSE?&amp;#160;These Americans did and are changing the world.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing her husband, &quot;American Sniper&quot; Chris Kyle, bestselling author Taya Kyle entered a period of&amp;#160;deep grief. And yet the experience served as a catalyst for profound growth. Taya found her own reserve of strength with the help of the generous love and support of family and friends&amp;#8212;and also many strangers across America, who selflessly shared their own stories of suffering, survival, and triumph. Inspired by her experience, Taya&amp;#160;discovered her calling: spreading a message of how love, passion, and service can combine to help us persevere over personal pain and heal our communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with trusted collaborator Jim DeFelice (coauthor of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;American Wife&lt;/em&gt;),&amp;#160;Taya tells her own story, as well as those of other Americans who have built extraordinary lives after traveling down life&amp;#8217;s most difficult roads&amp;#8212;through loss, illness, all manner of setback. They embody the &amp;#8220;American spirit&amp;#8221; of resilience, faith, togetherness that has built the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Spirit&lt;/em&gt; profiles more than 30 individuals, young and old, rich and not-so-rich, famous and unknown, who have overcome hardship and done extraordinary things for their communities and for the nation at large. The 9/11 survivor, badly burned over 60% of his body, who asked himself &lt;em&gt;What debt do I owe to God? And to my fellow human beings? What am I supposed to do with this miracle of survival?&lt;/em&gt; The man with the hole in his heart who runs ultramarathons. The young cancer victim whose lemonade stand inspired a revolutionary new model for fighting cancer. The blind cyclist; the pastor who became an undercover investigator, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, these stories teach us how to find purpose and heal the world, no matter the difficulty. &amp;#8220;Every action, big or small,&amp;#8221; Taya writes, &amp;#8220;has the potential to spark someone else&amp;#8217;s movement.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
