          &lt;em&gt;For the sake of her daughters can she marry a stranger?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Lynn Chanak is living the nightmare every mother fears. There was a mix-up at the hospital. Her baby isn&#39;t hers. And the only way she can have the baby she gave birth to and keep the child she loves is to marry Adam Landry–a man she doesn&#39;t even know.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the sake of his daughters can he marry a woman he&#39;ll never love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Adam was devastated when his Jenny died. And his only consolation was their daughter. But as much as he loves Rose, he can&#39;t stand to think that the child Jenny carried for nine months will grow up without him. If marrying a stranger is what it takes to have both his daughters, then that&#39;s what he&#39;ll do. Even though he still loves Jenny…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;For the sake of their daughters can they make this marriage work?&lt;/em&gt;
