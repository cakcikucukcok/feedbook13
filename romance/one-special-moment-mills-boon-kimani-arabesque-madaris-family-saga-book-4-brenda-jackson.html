          &lt;strong&gt;An Outrageous Offer&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To help her brother&#39;s struggling cosmetics company, schoolteacher Colby Wingate travels to Los Angeles for one last, desperate gamble–to have superstar actor Sterling Hamilton endorse her brother&#39;s new perfume. But Sterling thinks Colby has come to answer his want ad for a woman who would bear his child. When she realizes what Sterling is looking for, Colby is shocked that he expects any woman, let alone her, to comply no matter how much money he&#39;s willing to pay….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Passionate Bargain&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A childhood loss has made Sterling determined not to get too close to anyone–even the strikingly beautiful Colby. But somehow, he has to convince Colby to become the mother of his child…with no strings attached. What he doesn&#39;t expect is for his carefully laid plans to explode into restless, fiery desire. Now, Sterling knows he needs Colby for much more–if only he can prove his intentions are for real and that he&#39;ll cherish and love her…forever.&lt;/p&gt;
