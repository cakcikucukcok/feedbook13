      <meta name="description" content="If you or someone you know is experiencing difficulties with a drug addiction, you know how damaging it can be to a person&#39;s life. However, if you are a person or know someone who has just begun using drugs, you may not be fully aware of the dangers you will face once you become addicted to the drug. One of the best things you can do to either avoid or treat a drug addiction is to make sure you are well informed on the subject.   It is advised that you get your information from a reliable source, such as this book, rather than from other drug users. The chapters in this book will touch on some key points that will help you with beating or avoiding an addiction which may eventually lead to death.   Many people think that their addiction problems will never be solved or that change is impossible. This is not true! With proper guidance, determination, support, and the helpful information in this book, a better drug-free life will be within reach." />
