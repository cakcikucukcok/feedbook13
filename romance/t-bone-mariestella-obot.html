  <title>T-Bone - MarieStella Obot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lora Davies is beyond frustrated with the singles scene. After dating for years without  success, she contacts her old college flame, Ken Howard, to confess that she still has feelings for him. With encouragement from her
friends Katie, Sandra, and Keisha, Lora prepares to travel to Los Angeles in an attempt to capture his heart once again. A few days later, as she settles into her airplane seat, Lora knows she has just taken the first step in becoming closer to the man she has secretly admired for almost a decade. But what if he does not feel the same way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katies life seems perfect from a distance, but she is harboring a horrible secret from her friends. Trapped in an abusive marriage, Katie keeps her troubles quiet for fear of scaring her friends into making commitments. Yet as the secrets of her marital woes are revealed, a tragedy strikes that causes all the women to carefully examine their own relationships and discover that fantasies can never resemble real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this contemporary romance novel, four women determined not to part ways or live miles apart follow their hearts to a new territory where they hope to find solace, peace, joy, laughter, and, most of all, true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
