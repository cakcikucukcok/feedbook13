  <title>Her Smile, His Power - Sherrie Gourdin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people do not communicate emotions and feelings. Perhaps their personality is emotionally detached because somewhere in their life they had to put up a wall to protect their heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This was my situation. God showed me how to overcome living with a person who was emotionally detached. When we hear what God has to say and obey it in dealing with our spouses, he will change the other person for our benefit, and in this process we are the better person too. Im glad God knew exactly what he was getting when he made me. When we get married its only what we think we are getting that we get. Im so glad my God is big enough to fix anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Where there is silence, so is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;You see, sometimes, when family and friends are around all the time, the noise keeps us from hearing God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It is so easy to pick up the phone and say, Guess what? and tell someone about our day, or ask their opinion about something, perhaps just to have somebody listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Just like women do not want to share their husbands, so is our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;We have a jealous God. He wants us to talk to him every day, even about the smallest things. And he has been so good to me. I know he certainly deserves my, Guess what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Because hes always listening, even when were not.&lt;/p&gt;" />
