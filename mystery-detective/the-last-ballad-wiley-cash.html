  <title>The Last Ballad - Wiley Cash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the Southern Book Prize for Literary Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named a Best Book of 2017 by the Chicago Public Library and the American Library Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Wiley Cash reveals the dignity and humanity of people asking &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for a fair shot in an unfair world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&amp;#160;Christina Baker Kline, author of &lt;em&gt;A Piece of the World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Orphan Train&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the celebrated &lt;em&gt;A Land More Kind Than Home&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;This Dark Road to Mercy&lt;/em&gt; returns with this eagerly awaited new novel, set in the Appalachian foothills of North Carolina in 1929 and inspired by actual events. The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;chronicle of&amp;#160;an ordinary woman&amp;#8217;s struggle for dignity and her rights in a textile mill, &lt;em&gt;The Last Ballad&lt;/em&gt; is a moving tale of courage in the face of oppression and injustice, with the emotional power of Ron Rash&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt;, Dennis Lehane&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Given Day&lt;/em&gt;, and the unforgettable films &lt;em&gt;Norma Rae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Silkwood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve times a week, twenty-eight-year-old Ella May Wiggins makes the two-mile trek to and from her job on the night shift at American Mill No. 2 in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The insular community considers the mill&amp;#8217;s owners&amp;#8212;the newly arrived Goldberg brothers&amp;#8212;white but not American and expects them to pay Ella May and other workers less because they toil alongside African Americans like Violet, Ella May&amp;#8217;s best friend. While the dirty, hazardous job at the mill earns Ella May a paltry nine dollars for seventy-two hours of work each week, it&amp;#8217;s the only opportunity she has. Her no-good husband, John, has run off again, and she must keep her four young children alive with whatever work she can find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the union leaflets begin circulating, Ella May has a taste of hope, a yearning for the better life the organizers promise. But the mill owners, backed by other nefarious forces, claim the union is nothing but a front for the Bolshevik menace sweeping across Europe. To maintain their control, the owners will use every means in their power, including bloodshed, to prevent workers from banding together. On the night of the county&amp;#8217;s biggest rally, Ella May, weighing the costs of her choice, makes up her mind to join the movement&amp;#8212;a decision that will have lasting consequences for her children, her friends, her town&amp;#8212;indeed all that she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five years later, Ella May&amp;#8217;s daughter Lilly, now an elderly woman, tells her nephew about his grandmother and the events that transformed their family. Illuminating the most painful corners of their history, she reveals, for the first time, the tragedy that befell Ella May after that fateful union meeting in 1929.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intertwining myriad voices, Wiley Cash brings to life the heartbreak and bravery of the now forgotten struggle of the labor movement in early twentieth-century America&amp;#8212;and pays tribute to the thousands of heroic women and men who risked their lives to win basic rights for all workers. Lyrical, heartbreaking, and haunting, this eloquent novel confirms Wiley Cash&amp;#8217;s place among our nation&amp;#8217;s finest writers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
