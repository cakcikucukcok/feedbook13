  <title>Notes from Beyond the Fringe - Julie Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one ever accused Greg Stott of not having a sense of humor. His retelling of experiences often left his readers begging for more and now there is an entire book dedicated to the events that comprise life (as he knows it).&lt;p&gt; 
Notes from Beyond the Fringe is a unique and entertaining collection of stories based on one mans view of the world around him. With a distinct and engaging voice, Stott relates his life through vignettes that, while seemingly ordinary in nature, either wind up impacting him or are subsequently addressed by him in a manner that is anything but ordinary.  His subjects encompass a wide variety of topics familiar to just about everybody but are liberally skewed in the retelling by influences that began with growing up in a pre-tofu California in the 1950&#39;s, were adjusted as a result of teen life endured in a boarding school, befogged by a misspent youth and eventually warped from the effects of being a single parent.&lt;p&gt; 
Very little escapes Stott&#39;s attention and subsequent &#39;adjustments&#39; to his concept of reality.  Whether describing how to deliver 400+ newspapers at speed in a 1965 Volkswagen, explaining difficult situations to his pre-pubescent tax deduction, the acquisition of proper Texas BBQ etiquette or relating his seemingly endless failures in dealing with animals, offspring, relationships, hot rods and amateur carpentry, the stories are both original and told with a perspective that can only come about as the result severe mental instability.&lt;p&gt; 
Be prepared to spend hours attempting to understand how anyone could have survived so long in an uncontrolled environment and enjoying the humor that is, more often than not,  related at the author&#39;s expense in Notes from Beyond the Fringe. Your perspective on the world will never be the same." />
