  <title>Effie - Suzanne Fagence Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Effie Gray, a beautiful and intelligent young socialite, rattled the foundations of England&#39;s Victorian age. Married at nineteen to John Ruskin, the leading art critic of the time, she found herself trapped in a loveless, unconsummated union after Ruskin rejected her on their wedding night. On a trip to Scotland she met John Everett Millais, Ruskin&#39;s protégé, and fell passionately in love with him. In a daring act, Effie left Ruskin, had their marriage annulled and entered into a long, happy marriage with Millais. Suzanne Fagence Cooper has gained exclusive access to Effie&#39;s previously unseen letters and diaries to tell the complete story of this scandalous love triangle. In Cooper&#39;s hands, this passionate love story also becomes an important new look at the work of both Ruskin and Millais with Effie emerging as a key figure in their artistic development. &lt;i&gt;Effie &lt;/i&gt;is a heartbreakingly beautiful book about three lives passionately entwined with some of the greatest paintings of the pre-Raphaelite period.&lt;/p&gt;" />
