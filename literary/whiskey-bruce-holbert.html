  <title>Whiskey - Bruce Holbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whiskey &lt;/i&gt;burns pleasantly as it goes down, but has a lasting, powerful effect. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brothers Andre and Smoker were raised in a cauldron of their parents&#39; failed marriage and appetite for destruction, and find themselves in the same straits as adults--navigating not only their own marriages, but also their parents&#39; frequent collision with the law and one another. The family lives in Electric City, Washington, just a few miles south of the Colville Indian Reservation. Fiercely loyal and just plain fierce, they&#39;re bound by a series of darkly comedic and hauntingly violent events: domestic trouble; religious fanaticism; benders punctuated with pauses to dry out that never stick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a religious zealot takes off with Smoker&#39;s daughter, there&#39;s no question that his brother--who continues doggedly to try and put his life in order--will join him in an attempt to return her. Maybe the venture will break them both beyond repair or maybe it will redeem them. Or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whiskey&lt;/i&gt; is the story of two brothers, their parents, and three wrecked marriages, a searching book about family life at its most distressed--about kinship, failure, enough liquor to get through it all, and ultimately a dark and hard-earned grace. With the gruff humor of Cormac McCarthy and a dash of the madcap irony of Charles Portis, and a strong, authentic literary voice all his own, Bruce Holbert traverses the harsh landscape of America&#39;s northwestern border and finds a family unlike any you&#39;ve met before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
