  <title>Black Klansman - Ron Stallworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The extraordinary true story and basis for the Academy Award winning film &lt;i&gt;BlacKkKlansman&lt;/i&gt;, written and directed by Spike Lee, produced by Jordan Peele, and starring John David Washington and Adam Driver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When detective Ron Stallworth, the first black detective in the history of the Colorado Springs Police Department, comes across a classified ad in the local paper asking for all those interested in joining the Ku Klux Klan to contact a P.O. box, Detective Stallworth does his job and responds with interest, using his real name while posing as a white man. He figures he&#39;ll receive a few brochures in the mail, maybe even a magazine, and learn more about a growing terrorist threat in his community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later the office phone rings, and the caller asks Ron a question he thought he&#39;d never have to answer, &quot;Would you like to join our &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;?&quot; This is 1978, and the KKK is on the rise in the United States. Its Grand Wizard, David Duke, has made a name for himself, appearing on talk shows, and major magazine interviews preaching a &quot;kinder&quot; Klan that wants nothing more than to preserve a heritage, and to restore a nation to its former glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron answers the caller&#39;s question that night with a yes, launching what is surely one of the most audacious, and incredible undercover investigations in history.  Ron recruits his partner Chuck to play the &quot;white&quot; Ron Stallworth, while Stallworth himself conducts all subsequent phone conversations. During the months-long investigation, Stallworth sabotages cross burnings, exposes white supremacists in the military, and even befriends David Duke himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Klansman&lt;/i&gt; is an amazing true story that reads like a crime thriller, and a searing portrait of a divided America and the extraordinary heroes who dare to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
