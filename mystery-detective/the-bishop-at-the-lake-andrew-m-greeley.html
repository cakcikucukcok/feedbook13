  <title>The Bishop at the Lake - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Matters of succession lead to attempted murder in the latest of Greeley&#39;s popular mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archbishop Malachi Nolan has designs on the Diocese of Chicago despite the fact the Most Reverend Blackwood Ryan, himself recently appointed an archbishop, is currently in line for the post. Assigned to keep watch on his rival, Blackie travels to the Nolan family estate in Grand Banks, where he soon finds himself immersed in an entirely different dynastic struggle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike Nolan, founder of Aviation Electronics, isn&#39;t even dead yet, but his children, grandchildren, and their respective spouses are already feuding over who will inherit control of the multimillion-dollar company. The only family member who doesn&#39;t have a stake in the quarrel is the clerical Malachi . . . so why is he the one targeted by an unknown killer? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to the bottom of the mystery, Blackie will have to sort through the tangled family dynamics of this highly dysfunctional clan, as well as figure how out his fellow archbishop was nearly stung to death by hornets inside a locked room!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
