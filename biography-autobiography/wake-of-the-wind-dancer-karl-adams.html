  <title>Wake of the Wind Dancer - Karl Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Wake of the Wind Dancer&lt;/i&gt; was written from a daily accounting of the journey that Karl Adams took across America in his kayak, the Wind Dancer, and on foot.  He followed or closely paralleled the path of seven of Americas early explorers; Lewis and Clark among them.  He is the only person known to have covered this entire route by boat and on foot, with no support team or power other than the energy supplied by his own body.&lt;p&gt;
Each stroke of his paddles brought an ever changing, panoramic view and a  different and challenging adventure; at times humorous and at other times perilous, sometimes even life threatening.  When he ran out of waterways he walked, pulling the kayak behind him for three hundred and fifty miles. He took pictures of the interesting and beautiful sights along the way which he used to create a travelogue of his journey to show to his family and friends at the end of his year of travels.  Wake of the Wind Dancer is a stimulating, photographic narrative that provides a valuable historical record of his exciting and sometimes harrowing year-long adventure from Oregon to Florida on foot and by kayak!" />
