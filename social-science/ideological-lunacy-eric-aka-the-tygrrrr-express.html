  <title>Ideological Lunacy - eric aka the Tygrrrr Express</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&quot;Put the varnish remover back on the shelf! You won&#39;t need it when reading Eric&#39;s latest book, Ideological Lunacy. In Eric&#39;s true, take no prisoners style he impales liberals with a mixture of facts, wit, and outright humor melded together in a writing style guaranteed to grab your attention and not let go. This is a must read for anyone who is wondering why America is upside down.&quot;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lt. Col. Bill Cowan&lt;/b&gt;, Fox News military analyst and author of Snatching Hillary: A Satirical Novel&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Eric has two ambitions: To impregnate a pretty Republican Jewish brunette (after marrying her) and to save his beloved America. This book will further both goals. Incisive, impassioned and laugh-out-loud funny, what smart politically conservative Jewish girl could possibly resist Eric after reading this? What loyal American could not be inspired after reading Eric&#39;s cutting arguments?&quot;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trevor Loudon&lt;/b&gt;, international speaker and author of The Enemies Within&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Eric has done it again. His new book Ideological Lunacy is politically conservative &#39;Lenny Bruce.&#39; I love when somebody can restate an idea from a perspective I haven&#39;t thought about, and be clever and funny. The opportunities for derivative thought in Eric&#39;s work is endless, and I suggest adding Ideological Lunacy to your library as a &#39;must read.&#39;&quot;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Jackson&lt;/b&gt;, Syndicated Radio Host and Best-Selling Author of The Big Black Lie.&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Eric makes me laugh. Not just because I feel his opinions about liberals are complete lunacy; but because he can make politics fun and entertaining.&quot;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leslie Marshall&lt;/b&gt;, Nationally Syndicated Radio Host and Fox News Contributor&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&quot;A raucous roller coaster of Republican rants  worth the ride.&quot;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dee Dee Sorvino&lt;/b&gt;, Emmy award winning TV host and commentator; former Chairman, Young Republican National Federation&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Ideological Lunacy&lt;/I&gt; is what happens to the left when their worst plans inevitably fail. The world is on fire. Islamists are trying to spread a worldwide caliphate. Terrorists are running wild. There is global financial instability. Conservatives are busy trying to save the world from domestic and foreign threats. Liberals led by rich white leftists are worried about temperature changes in a world God created and the name of a football team.&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;From pointy-headed witless academics to celebrity bimbos, &lt;I&gt;Ideological Lunacy&lt;/I&gt; calls out the craziest people in society and attempts to teach them how to act normal. Whether your favorite charity is Burn the Forests or Molotov Mocktails for Metrosexuals, the political spectrum has space for you. Have some dead cow and some sugar-flavored carbonation and enjoy this book. For the perpetually angry left, &lt;I&gt;Ideological Lunacy&lt;/I&gt; is an intervention.&lt;/br&gt;" />
