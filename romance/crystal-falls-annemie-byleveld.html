  <title>Crystal Falls - Annemie Byleveld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Payton has always been taunted by dreams so vivid and real that it haunted
her waking days. Going in search for a place she belonged was the step she
feared the most. But it turned out to be the easiest one of all. Her father was
a werewolf, her mother a witch turned vampire. Before she knew it, she got
involved in a world filled with magical, supernatural beings. Her journey
toward the truth became even darker, filled with blood-filled rivers, hidden
spells, and love so strong it consumed her. Caleb might be another vampire,
but he was also the one who loved her from the moment he saw her as a tiny
baby. When death is the only way to keep on living, Paytons choice became
a war worth fighting for. Immortality seemed to be a sweet victory." />
