  <title>A Week from Next Tuesday: Joy Keeps Showing Up (Because Christ Keeps Showing Up) - Matthew Rich, Thomas W. Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you know what will happen a week from next Tuesday? You might find a quite ordinary day with work, laundry, and a child&#39;s soccer game. Or perhaps the day will bring an unexpected tragedy for someone you love. Maybe something completely out of the blue will surprise you. While no one can know what today, tomorrow, or a week from next Tuesday will hold, you can know Christ&#39;s gift of JOY in your life every day. Despite our best efforts to squelch its presence, JOY keeps showing up because Jesus Christ keeps showing up. With stories from pastor Matt Rich&#39;s life and ministry, A Week from Next Tuesday explores the birth, life, death, resurrection, and promised return of Christ to provide a glimpse of this amazing gift that cannot be lost or stolen. Ideal for personal devotion, small group study, and all those seeking something more in their own lives and the church, this book invites you to receive the gift of JOY as you begin to recognize Christ&#39;s presence in the ordinary, tragic, and surprising moments of your life." />
