  <title>Kidz 2 Cherish - Andrew Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this reader for youngsters, three pre-teen siblings pull everyone along through a series of happenings where ingrained traits of responsibility and courage along with a free spirit stand them in good stead. 
Readers are first introduced to the oldest of the three, a fifth-grader, when a dilemma at his school demonstrates why, exactly, he is known around the town as a Mister Fixit. 
Then along comes Nellie, a third-grader, who has a twinkle in her eye and a fixation on animals  stuffed or real, it doesnt matter  and is particularly keen on all things ladybug. 
The youngest, Picadillo, is a carefree little lad who never fails to entertain and surprise. An infatuation with videos, movies and role-playing make him a unique piece of work. 
One of the missions Andrew Collins undertook in Kidz 2 Cherish was to develop compelling characters who exemplify the how-tos of growing up purposefully. Some of the events happening to and among the lead characters require fictional imagination, while other situations are pictured as being real and in the moment (though at times wacky). The idea was to depict kids having fun being kids with a theme of desirable traits woven into their decision-making and behavior. 
A chapter book, its 165 pages make for wholesome, inspiring and often humorous entertainment. As reviewed by the dependable critic JWC, ESQ: Lots of fun for the young reader but also lots of morality and character-building lessons. 
Amusingly illustrated by fourteen-year-old artist Andie Carver." />
