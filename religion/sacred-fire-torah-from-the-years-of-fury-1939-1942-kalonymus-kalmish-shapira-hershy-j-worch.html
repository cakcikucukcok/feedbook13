  <title>Sacred Fire: Torah from the Years of Fury 1939-1942 - Kalonymus Kalmish Shapira, Hershy J. Worch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Sacred Fire: Torah from the Years of Fury (1939-1942)&lt;/i&gt; consists of commentaries on each weekly Torah portion. It also includes a number of lengthy sermons delivered on the major Jewish Festivals as well as a few discourses alluding to people loved and lost. Because writing is not permitted on the Sabbath, these &quot;words of Torah&quot; were transcribed from memory, after the Sabbath or festival had ended. Although the pages of &lt;i&gt;Sacred Fire&lt;/i&gt; are not stained with the names of its author&#39;s tormentors, there are numerous references to historical events through which parallels can be drawn. Rabbi Shapira often refers, for example, to the binding of Isaac and the martyrdom of Rabbi Akiba. &lt;i&gt;Sacred Fire&lt;/i&gt; forms a religious, spiritual response to the Holocaust that speaks from the heart of the darkness. In doing so, it may well form the basis for what could one day become Judaism&#39;s formal liturgical response to the events that occurred during those years of fury." />
