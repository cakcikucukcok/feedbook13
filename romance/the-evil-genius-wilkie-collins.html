  <title>The Evil Genius - Wilkie Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wilkie Collins wrote a succession of extraordinarily powerful novels of private life; of these &amp;quot;The Evil Genius&amp;quot; is among the finest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story is motivated by the attraction between Herbert Linley and the woman he hires as governess for his child Kitty&amp;mdash;the long suffering Sydney Westerfield. As one expects with Collins, the story is driven forward with deft assurance. Yet he also treats the theme of adultery and divorce in a manner quite unconventional for his time&amp;mdash;and, remarkably, he manages to draw readers into a sympathetic understanding of both of the main female characters: the offending governess and the aggrieved wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Evil Genius&amp;quot; was a very considerable success when first published; indeed, it brought Collins more financially than any of his other works. Over a century later its sinews retain the strength to speak powerfully to the reader; lively and intelligent, it is perhaps the finest of Collins&amp;rsquo; later novels." />
