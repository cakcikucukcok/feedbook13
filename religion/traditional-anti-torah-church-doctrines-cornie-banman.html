  <title>Traditional Anti-Torah Church Doctrines - Cornie Banman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever stopped to think whether the doctrines you hear in your church are actually coming from the word of the creator? In Traditional Anti-Torah Church Doctrines, author Cornie Banman offers an analysis of doctrines to help Christians ascertain whether a doctrine comes directly from God or originates from man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banman explains how and why traditional Christendom has rejected the Ten Commandments and how that belief has inevitably created an anti-God messiah. In &lt;i&gt;Traditional Anti-Torah Church Doctrines&lt;/i&gt;, he shows how:&lt;/p&gt; A subtle and powerful philosophy of anti-Jew doctrines has indoctrinated traditional Christians into believing the Messiah&#39;s first coming was to abolish the Ten Commandments&lt;/br&gt; The philosophy of a few church fathers has undermined the Ten Commandments by elevating manmade traditions to commandment status&lt;/br&gt; An anti-Jew philosophy plays a key role in abolishing the commandments and exposes its foundation&lt;/br&gt;The God of Abraham has given mankind a simple formula to test and measure all doctrines against his word&lt;/br&gt; Anyone can use that test against all doctrines to see whether they are inspired by the God of the scriptures or by the gods of this world.&lt;/br&gt; A person who&#39;s snared by deceived indoctrination can get back into alignment with God&#39;s true word&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrating his beliefs with biblical evidence, Banman provides guidance for testing and measuring the instructions coming from your church with God&#39;s truth in a simple way.&lt;/p&gt;
