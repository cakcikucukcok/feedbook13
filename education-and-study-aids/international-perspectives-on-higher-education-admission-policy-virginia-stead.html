  <title>International Perspectives on Higher Education Admission Policy - Virginia Stead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The promise of this admission policy reader arises from the embodiment of research from 58 authors, six continents, 20 time zones, 20+ first languages, and a broad array of research methodologies. Four sections aggregate key themes within the text: &lt;BR&gt; (1) 	National Perspectives on Higher Education Admission Policy; &lt;BR&gt; (2) 	Theoretical Approaches to Higher Education Admission Policy; &lt;BR&gt; (3) 	Applicant Recruitment and Student Support Services in Higher Education; and &lt;BR&gt; (4) 	Diversity and Equity in Higher Education Admission Policy Implementation. &lt;BR&gt; This book&#39;s global chorus of professional experience, investigation, and insight is unprecedented in its breadth and depth, illuminating a rare swath of challenges and opportunities that Internet-sourced international higher education makes visible. Although each chapter is an independent research report, together they generate a new landscape for admission policy orientation, exploration, and activism. The sheer range of policies and organizational infrastructure will alert all readers to many complexities within the admissions process that remain invisible within single or multiple but similar cultural and political contexts. &lt;BR&gt; Many of these authors have demonstrated courage along with their intellectual acumen in tackling politically sensitive, culturally taboo, and personally dangerous topics within their research. Theirs is a moving testimony to the global quest for fairness within the world of admission policy implementation and to the power of access to higher education. Together, we are determined to advance equitable admissions praxis within all institutions of higher learning and promising futures for all students." />
