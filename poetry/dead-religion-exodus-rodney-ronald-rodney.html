  <title>Dead Religion - Exodus Rodney, Ronald Rodney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dead Religion
Priests decorated in the finest linen black silk robes
The church interior covered in platinum gold
Custom made cups over floweth with red wine and expensive olive oil
Congregation and choir dressed in robs acquired for royal
All talk and no action
The preachers lips stunk with dead religion
Their words make victims out of those who listened
Confined to an emotional and mental prison
Church leaders communed with Satan at night
Designing tactics of trickery casting spells of witchery
In shock I am astounded that men are still bound
Entangled in Lucifers web
While their women lay naked and molested in the serpents bed
Their vessels are still broken
Ushers are aggressive salesmen
Accumulating one billion dollars a year inside their offering cups
Yet not one prophetic word is spoken
And the hungry and poor receive not one token
Nor a helping hand that&#39;s given
Evidence of negligence and neglect
These are signs!!!
These are signs I say!!!
These are signs!!!
