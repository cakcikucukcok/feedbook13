          &lt;strong&gt;The wilderness at the heart of the Australian Northern Territory was no place for delicate city beauty Samantha Langdon.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cattleman Ross Sunderland wouldn&#39;t have agreed to act as guide if he&#39;d known Samantha had signed up for the trip. Their one meeting had sparked an overwhelming attraction and, determined to resist her, loner Ross had vowed to avoid her at all costs. Sam could see in his hard, handsome face that Ross didn&#39;t want her along.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But they were seduced by the danger and primitive beauty around them, and raw instinct took over as their passion could no longer be denied….&lt;/p&gt;
