  <title>A Woman Loved - Andreï Makine, Geoffrey Strachan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fascinating story of a young Russian filmmaker&#39;s attempts to portray Catherine the Great, before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catherine the Great&#39;s life seems to have been made for the cinema--her rise to power; her reportedly countless love affairs and wild sexual escapades; the episodes of betrayal, revenge, and even murder--there&#39;s no shortage of historical drama. But Oleg Erdmann, a young Russian filmmaker, seeks to discover and portray Catherine&#39;s essential, emotional truth, her real life beyond the rumors and façade. His first screenplay just barely makes it past the Soviet film board and is assigned to a talented director, but the resulting film fails to avoid the usual clichés. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as he struggles to find a place for himself in the new order, Oleg agrees to work with an old friend on a television series that becomes a quick success--as well as increasingly lurid, a far cry from his original vision. He continues to seek the real Catherine elsewhere.&lt;br&gt;      With &lt;i&gt;A Woman Loved&lt;/i&gt;, Andreï Makine delivers a sweeping novel about the uses of art, the absurdity of history, and the overriding power of human love, if only it can be uncovered and allowed to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
