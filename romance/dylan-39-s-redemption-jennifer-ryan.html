  <title>Dylan&#39;s Redemption - Jennifer Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a new sheriff in Fallbrook . . . Meet Dylan McBride.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessie Thompson had one hell of a week. Dylan McBride, the boy she loved, skipped town without a word. Then her drunk of a father tried to kill her, and she fled Fallbrook, vowing never to return. Eight years later, her father is dead, and Jessie reluctantly goes home&amp;#8212;only to come face-to-face with the man who shattered her heart. A man who, for nearly a decade, believed she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dylan accepted the position as sheriff of Fallbrook looking for a fresh start and a chance to uncover the truth about Jessie&amp;#8217;s disappearance. He knew he&amp;#8217;d have to face a few ghosts . . . he just never thought one would be Jessie, all grown up, stunning . . . and alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pull between them is instant, but Dylan&amp;#8217;s heart has already mourned Jessie, and she has secrets she can never share. Can they escape the darkness of their past for a chance at a bright future together?&lt;/p&gt;" />
