  <title>Projectify - Jeff Schwisow, Kelly Irving, Ellie Scroeder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even the best laid strategic plans are not enough to keep on top of today&amp;rsquo;s dynamic and competitive marketplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the 20th century adage that a business is &amp;#39;either growing or dying&amp;#39; is no longer good enough - you can&amp;#39;t just do what you&amp;rsquo;ve always done and make it bigger, or do it more productively. Today, your business is &amp;ldquo;either evolving or declining&amp;#39; - businesses that can&amp;#39;t stay ahead of the pace of change are destined for obscurity or extinction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question today&amp;#39;s CEO or leader must ask themselves is not &amp;lsquo;How do I keep up?&amp;rsquo;, but &amp;lsquo;How do I focus on the future so that I am leading from the front, driving change instead of responding to it?&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is to Projectify.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using projects to create a bridge between the business and its people, business leaders can leverage the bandwidth and capability of their entire organisation so that strategy is a continuous process &amp;ndash; where the business constantly adapts to the changing environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, leading project expert Jeff Schwisow shows business leaders and senior managers how to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Engage and motivate their workforce by giving them meaningful work to be engaged in and a strategic contribution to be motivated by.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Free up the management team to focus on strategic direction and leadership rather than command and control of the troops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Create action and activity that progressively and persistently turns strategic intent into operational reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projectify is a book about strategy &amp;ndash; but strategy redefined. Strategy that is imbued with action. Strategy that is adaptive. Strategy that connects your organisation to its realisation. Strategy that has life!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projectify is a project book that isn&amp;#39;t really about projects - at least not how to do projects. It is a book about how to use projects and a project mindset to create an organisation that evolves to meet the needs and wants of its market, a place where customers are eager to invest their hard-earned money, a business that competitors look to emulate or defend against and a workplace where the culture &amp;ndash; not the payroll &amp;ndash; attracts and retains the best talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
