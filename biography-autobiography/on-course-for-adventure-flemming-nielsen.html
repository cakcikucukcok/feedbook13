  <title>On Course for Adventure - Flemming Nielsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1958, Flemming Nielsen and his older brother Aage left Denmark to begin a new life in Canada.
Flemming was only seventeen, and he could not have guessed that his first job at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto would lead to a forty-year career in the entertainment and cultural fields. During that time he wore many different hats: clerk, technician, producer-director, TV program manager and interviewer, cinema owner, magazine publisher and film festival president. His business life was full of exciting people, exploits and challenges.
He married Lorie Doucette in 1964, and three years later they moved to Calgary, Alberta, where their two daughters were born.
They retired in 1998, sold their home, packed a minivan with lifes necessities and headed for Los Cabos at the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula. Flemming had never been to Mexico. Neither he nor Lorie could speak Spanish. They didnt know anyone, and they had no place to live, but they were prepared for whatever new adventures lay ahead.
These recollections of an extraordinary life, lived to the full, have been assembled for the benefit of family, in Canada and in Europe, as well as for friends, acquaintances and anyone else who might like to know more." />
