  <title>Lookaway, Lookaway - Wilton Barnhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of &lt;/i&gt;Slate&#39;s&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;Kirkus Review&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Best Books of 2013 and &lt;/i&gt;The New York Times, &lt;i&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Indie Bound bestseller: &quot;Lookaway, Lookaway is a wild romp through the South, and therefore the history of our nation, written by an absolute ringmaster of fiction.&quot; --Alice Sebold,&lt;/i&gt; New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author of&lt;/i&gt; The Lovely Bones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerene Jarvis Johnston and her husband Duke are exemplars of Charlotte, North Carolina&#39;s high society, where old Southern money--and older Southern secrets--meet the new wealth of bankers, boom-era speculators, and carpetbagging social climbers. Steely and implacable, Jerene presides over her family&#39;s legacy of paintings at the Mint Museum; Duke, the one-time college golden boy and descendant of a Confederate general, whose promising political career was mysteriously short-circuited, has settled into a comfortable semi-senescence as a Civil War re-enactor.  Jerene&#39;s brother Gaston is an infamously dissolute bestselling historical novelist who has never managed to begin his long-dreamed-of literary masterpiece, while their sister Dillard is a prisoner of unfortunate life decisions that have made her a near-recluse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the four Johnston children wander perpetually toward scandal and mishap. Annie, the smart but matrimonially reckless real estate maven; Bo, a minister at war with his congregation; Joshua, prone to a series of gay misadventures, and Jerilyn, damaged but dutiful to her expected role as debutante and eventual society bride. Jerene must prove tireless in preserving the family&#39;s legacy, Duke&#39;s fragile honor, and what&#39;s left of the dwindling family fortune. She will stop at nothing to keep what she has--but is it too much to ask for one ounce of cooperation from her heedless family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lookaway, Lookaway&lt;/i&gt;, Wilton Barnhardt has written a headlong, hilarious narrative of a family coming apart, a society changing beyond recognition, and an unforgettable woman striving to pull it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Fiction Book of 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
