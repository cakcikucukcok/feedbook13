  <title>Loving Ordinary Life - Anastasia Petrenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all want to live a happy life, but we can easily fall into a state of despondency. We prefer to smile, but more often we frown. We like being inspired, but most likely, we can&amp;#39;t recall the last time when we were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best books on happiness, the best self-help books, and motivational books already tell you how to achieve inspiration. You have heard hundreds of platitudes, affirmations, and inspirational quotes. Each inspirational book for seems valid, but is limited when you are stuck with depression, pain, and despair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loving Ordinary Life is meant to make a functional difference for teens, boys, girls, women, or men. It&amp;#39;s not a treatment for depression. It is a book about living a life where depression has no place, where you can love the life you live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loving Ordinary Life is your guide. It is designed so that you can open any page and find the inspirational thoughts for every day to act and improve your life when you&amp;#39;re feeling down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each chapter in Loving Ordinary Life is a tool for moving from a negative idle state to a positive proactive state. It displays to you the art of being present, free, and genuine every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to be more fulfilled and enjoy life more, if you&amp;#39;re open to quality changes, Loving Ordinary Life will become your loyal companion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything is within your power. You are the master of your life. How you experience it depends only on you. Take the lead.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
