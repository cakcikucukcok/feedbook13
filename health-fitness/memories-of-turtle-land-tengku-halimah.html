  <title>Memories of Turtle Land - Tengku Halimah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In todays mobile world, we often live at great distances from our childhood homes. Even if we still live where we grew up, the location has often changed significantly from the days of our youth. Years later, it can be difficult to find ways to share childhood memories of home with our children and friends.
Author Tengku Halimah wanted to share her memories of growing up in the eastern state of Malaysia, Trengganu, with the younger generation of her family. In Memories of Turtle Land, she reconnects the familys younger generation to a link that could be lost. She reminisces about childhood days spent in Kuala Trengganu with her siblings and the adventures they shared. Despite the strict upbringing of her father, she and her sisters managed to have fun growing up in a family of twelve. Building on information from her mother, Halimah also touches on the family history and the grandeur of the royal families, while not forgetting the ordinary life she had growing up in Trengganu with her siblings.
One of the most important things we can do is to share our memories with a younger generation; it provides them with a sense of a history that they may not otherwise understand. This memoir shares vivid memories, interesting and enlightening to those inside and outside the family." />
