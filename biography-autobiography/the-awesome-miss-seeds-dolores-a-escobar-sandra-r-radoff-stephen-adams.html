  <title>The Awesome Miss Seeds - Dolores A. Escobar, Sandra R. Radoff, Stephen Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Awesome Miss Seeds is the story of a child with disabilities whose courage, determination, and vision enabled her to become a remarkable teacher and leader in education. It is the story of Corinne A. Seedss personal challenges and eventual successes, a dramatic and inspiring story of a pioneer in progressive education who influenced the lives of thousands of elementary school children and their teachers throughout the nation. As principal of the UCLA Laboratory School for over thirty years, her leadership stands as the longest continuous demonstration of progressive education west of the Mississippi. Her influence can be seen in creative programs for school children today. Her personal story, however, has not been told outside of a select circle of colleagues, students, and friends. 
This book is of particular significance for children with special needs who encounter obstacles while pursuing their dreams. Virtually deaf and having extremely poor eyesight, Corinne A. Seeds grew up in an era before modern technology was perfected to assist her and without special-education programsas we know them todayto help her succeed. Yet her self-assurance, singleness of purpose, and extraordinary intelligence led her to accomplish what few of us will do in our lifetimes. 
The Awesome Miss Seeds can be enjoyed by children with a fourth-grade reading ability or as a story read by a teacher or parent. A brief background section for adults is included.  The book is intended to inform todays educators, parents, and the general public of the profound effect this extraordinary woman, relatively unknown, has had on elementary education.  The Awesome Miss Seeds is particularly relevant to the many children whose school experiences were changed forever because of the dedication and accomplishments of Corinne A. Seeds." />
