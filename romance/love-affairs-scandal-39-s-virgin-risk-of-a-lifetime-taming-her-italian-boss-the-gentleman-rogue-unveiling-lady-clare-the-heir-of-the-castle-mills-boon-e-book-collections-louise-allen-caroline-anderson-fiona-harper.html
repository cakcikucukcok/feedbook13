          &lt;strong&gt;Love Affairs&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six fabulous romances by talented writers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce all six novels, have been shortlisted for The RoNA Rose Award. This award will be presented at the Romantic Novelists&#39; Association&#39;s glittering ceremony in London on the 16th March.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Do you have a favourite?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SCANDAL’S VIRGIN by Louise Allen&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reeling from heartbreak, Lady Laura Campion has transformed herself into an infamous part of high society – flirtatious, alluring and utterly shocking – and yet she has always stopped short of absolute ruin. But now she has hope. The daughter she thought lost is alive, and under the guardianship of the powerful Avery Falconer, Earl of Wykeham and going into battle against Lord Wykeham might be her option to win little Alice back.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;RISK OF A LIFETIME by Caroline Anderson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Striding into A&amp;E, staggeringly handsome Dr Ed Shackleton sends Dr Annie Brooks’s heart racing! Men are off the menu for this single mum, but avoiding brooding Ed proves impossible… Ed’s fear of his hereditary illness means he’s ruled out love. Yet a fling with Annie makes him want the unthinkable. Can Annie convince Ed that love is always worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TAMING HER ITALIAN BOSS by Fiona Harper&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ruby Lange might be unconventional, but her struggle to find the ideal career isn&#39;t from lack of trying! Now the latest option is &quot;traveling nanny&quot;—so she takes a deep breath, packs her vintage suitcase and heads for Italy. Ruby&#39;s new boss, architect Max Martin, may be utterly gorgeous, but he&#39;s far too buttoned up for her liking!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE GENTLEMAN ROGUE by Margaret McPhee&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a Mayfair ballroom, beautiful Emma Northcote stands in amazement. For gazing at her with eyes she’d know anywhere is Ned Stratham – the man whose roguish charm once held her captivated. But that was another life, in another part of London.Their past is mired in secrets and betrayal, and their true identities are now at last revealed…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;UNVEILING LADY CLARE by Carol Townend&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sir Arthur Ferrer catches sight of her among the stands at the Twelfth Night joust. There is something about her eyes…. He&#39;s seen them before. But when he goes to find the mysterious woman who has so captivated him, she&#39;s disappeared! But this handsome knight is determined to unveil her secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE HEIR OF THE CASTLE by Scarlet Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the closest person tycoon Callan McGregor has to a father dies, he is left to organise the inheritance and stunning lawyer Laurie Jenkins is the most suitable assistant. Even though she makes brooding Callan’s pulse race, this is business – he cannot afford a distraction…&lt;/p&gt;
