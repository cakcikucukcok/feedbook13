  <title>McX - Ron Halliday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is going on in the Falkirk Triangle? Why are UFOs being reported in the skies all over Scotland? Are aliens abducting motorists on quiet country roads, while unknown creatures stalk the countryside and hide in the murky waters of Highland lochs? There is no question that Scotland is currently witnessing an extraordinary variety of paranormal activity - but was it any different in the past? No-one has ever solved the mysteries of Flannan Isle, the Standing Stones at Callanish, or the shadowy secrets of Rosslyn Chapel. McX sheds new light on these and many other enigmas from Scotland&#39;s past and present - from UFOs and the paranormal, to unexplained mysteries and dark secrets. The cases included are all genuine. They are all amazing. Some are disturbing. And some include elements that government agencies have tried to suppress. Until now shrouded in mystery and secrecy, these extraordinary case histories will convince you that in Scotland, the truth really is stranger than fiction." />
