  <title>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America&#39;s Underground Food Movements - Sandor Ellix Katz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An instant classic for a new generation of monkey-wrenching food activists. Food in America is cheap and abundant, yet the vast majority of it is diminished in terms of flavor and nutrition, anonymous and mysterious after being shipped thousands of miles and passing through inscrutable supply chains, and controlled by multinational corporations. In our system of globalized food commodities, convenience replaces quality and a connection to the source of our food. Most of us know almost nothing about how our food is grown or produced, where it comes from, and what health value it really has. It is food as pure corporate commodity. We all deserve much better than that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;em&gt;The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved&lt;/em&gt;, author Sandor Ellix Katz (&lt;em&gt;Wild Fermentation&lt;/em&gt;, Chelsea Green 2003) profiles grassroots activists who are taking on Big Food, creating meaningful alternatives, and challenging the way many Americans think about food. From community-supported local farmers, community gardeners, and seed saving activists, to underground distribution networks of contraband foods and food resources rescued from the waste stream, this book shows how ordinary people can resist the dominant system, revive community-based food production, and take direct responsibility for their own health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
