  <title>Mum and Dad, Please Listen to Me - Jenny McFall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Adults sometimes think children are too young to understand much of the world. Yet research tells us that a childs brain and cognitive development is far beyond that which most parents imagine. If parents really listen to their children, they can come to understand them better and in turn would have an easier and more enjoyable parenting experience.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Children expect parents to love them in the right way and give them sunshine. But how does that work in practice? In Mum and Dad, Please Listen to Me, teacher and parent Jenny McFall translates the combination of the essential elements of child psychological and social development and character education into a simple manual for every day use. Jenny covers the 50 most common challenges that parents are likely to encounter and the way to achieve positive outcomes and hands-on daily tasks to develop childrens sense of responsibility and independence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mum and Dad, Please Listen to Me shows you how to give your children the keys to put them on the path to a happy and more successful adulthood.&lt;/P&gt;" />
