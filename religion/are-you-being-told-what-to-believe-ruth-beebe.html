  <title>Are You Being Told What to Believe? - Ruth Beebe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The past fifty years has seen a steady progression from Christianity through various alternate systems of belief, including the theory of evolution, UFOs, aliens, paganism, witchcraft, and belief in the presence of gods and goddesses. TV, movies, books, and even our educational system all seem determined to gain control of our thoughts and beliefs.&lt;p&gt; 
Are you being told what to think? Are you being told what to believe? How important are our beliefs? Most of us dont really give a lot of thought to how our beliefs impact the world around us, or to what our beliefs really mean to us. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are You Being Told What to Believe?&lt;/i&gt; examines popular beliefs and demonstrates not only how all of these things are connected, but how your beliefs are being controlled. You must take charge of your mind, your thoughts, and your beliefs; if you dont, someone else will!&lt;p&gt;
Belief sets are almost as unique as the individual. So how important is this? Does it really matter what we believe? And could there be a greater effort underway to control your mind and thoughts? You decide!" />
