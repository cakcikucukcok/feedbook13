  <title>Web of Deceit - Katherine Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shortlisted for the 2013 Ned Kelly Award for Best Crime Fiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often  compared to Karin Slaughter and Patricia Cornwell, prize-winning author  Katherine Howell thrills readers in this gripping novel featuring a  determined homicide detective and a team of emergency medics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When  frantic man refuses to leave the car that witnesses say he deliberately  crashed, paramedics Jane and Alex think it&#39;s a desperate cry for help.  But his paranoid claims that someone is out to get him only confirm  official reports that he is delusional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he is indeed found dead in what looks like a suicide, Jane is uneasy: she remembers the raw terror in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective  Ella Marconi shares these doubts, which are compounded as the case  becomes increasingly tangled. The victim&#39;s boss tries to commit suicide,  a witness flees, and closer to home, a woman is attacked in front of  Jane&#39;s house. Then Alex&#39;s daughter goes missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ella tries  to add up the clues, the investigation is hampered by her budget-focused  boss. Then, just when she thinks she&#39;s closing in, a shocking turn of  events endangers more people, and Ella just may see the killer slip  through her hands.&lt;/p&gt;" />
