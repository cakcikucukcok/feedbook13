          &lt;strong&gt;They were suddenly…Mummy and Daddy! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Conservative businessman Jake Braddock had a heart that was all Texan male – and closely guarded. Following his stepmother’s death, he learned he’d be sharing custody of his five-year-old half sister with a sexy dancer – not his notion of the ideal mummy. Chloe Haskell had barely begun being mother to little Brianna when she found herself at odds with stuffy Jake, who seemed determined to fight her at every turn. But the long-legged beauty soon got under Jake’s skin in more ways than he cared to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now he had to decide whether he was ready to let Chloe into his heart – to help him build the family he’d always wanted…&lt;/p&gt;
