  <title>SPQR IX: The Princess and the Pirates - John Maddox Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As I walked back through the City, my mood was moderately elevated.    This appointment did not displease me nearly as much as I pretended.    Like most Romans I abhorred the very thought of sea duty, but this was   one of the rare occasions when I was looking forward to getting away   from Rome..... For years I had complained of the disorder of the City,   and now that it was gone, I found that I missed it.  All the peace and   quiet seemed unnatural.  I did not expect it to last.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger in &lt;i&gt;SPQR IX: The Princess and the Pirates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His   two years of aedileship over, Decius is ready for his next adventure.   He would rather do anything than join the war with Caesar in the dismal   forests of Gaul, so he and his slave/protégé Hermes find themselves on  a  mission to rid the Mediterranean of pirates. They set off with  shoddy  ships and sailors to the island of Cyprus, where a young  Cleopatra is  staying. Between her impressive crew and the ex-pirate  Ariston providing  insider knowledge of that cutthroat occupation,  Decius thinks he stands  a good chance of bringing himself some glory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That  would be too  simple, though.  The ruler of the island, Silvanus, is  murdered in a  most peculiar fashion and Decius, as a guest in his home,  has a sacred  duty to find and punish the guilty party. Because world  relations are  already strained, he would rather not suspect Cleopatra,  heir to the  Egyptian throne.  But she has plenty of reasons to hate  Rome and murder  runs in her family. Another guest and suspect is  Gabinius, who is in  exile and could have easily given up loyalty toward  his friend if it  meant a quicker return to Rome. In the meantime,  Decius is being  humiliated in his pirate hunt, and as if this weren&#39;t  enough, Aphrodite  herself seeks Decius&#39;s help by appearing to him in a  dream vision. As  Decius investigates world trade, the island history,  and the new kind of  piracy plaguing the waters, he is finding  connections more menacing  than he had ever imagined possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  this ninth book in the  series, Roberts crafts another skillful  mystery, this time fervently  pulsing with the collision of Roman,  Greek, and Egyptian interests.&lt;/p&gt;" />
