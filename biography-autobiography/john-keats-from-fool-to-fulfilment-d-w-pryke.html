  <title>John Keats from Fool to Fulfilment - D W Pryke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part biography, part history, part literary commentary, this detailed account of the poetic development of John Keats takes the reader from the poet&#39;s early childhood to the months just before his death. The setting is late October 1820, when Keats, having sailed to Italy in the hope the warmer climate would improve his failing health, had to endure 10 days&#39; strict quarantine in the Bay of Naples before being allowed to disembark. Those ten days provide the timescale for this narrative in which the young poet looks back on his life and traces his emergence as the &quot;youth elect&quot;, the chosen one of his generation. Keats began his writing career supported by a close circle of friends who were radical free-thinkers in matters of both politics and culture. They embraced revolutionary ideas of Hermeticism so popular in London at the time, convinced that Hermetic ideas would bring about social, religious and political change." />
