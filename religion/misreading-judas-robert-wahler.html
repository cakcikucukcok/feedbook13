  <title>Misreading Judas - Robert Wahler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Judas is the most important discovery in history. It bridges the gap between Eastern mystic teaching, Gnosticism, and the three Middle Eastern Abrahamic religions, informing all of them. Unfortunately, the Christianity-biased scholars assigned to its interpretation and those who have followed them do not understand it -- at all. They miss that Judas is the gnostic sacrifice, and that there is no traditional orthodox Jesus sacrificed - in the Gospel of Judas or in the Bible. Therefore, they miss the most important revelation of all time: that &#39;Jesus&#39; didn&#39;t die to save anyone, and that he was in truth preceded and succeeded by other Masters of equal stature. Here from gnostic texts that only just recently arose from the desert sands of Egypt, phoenix-like, is the detailed story of how the New Testament canonical &#39;Betrayal of Jesus&#39; became the inversion of the gnostic mastership installation story of James the Just, first-century savior. The true origin of the Christian message and its nullification of mystic Truth can now, at long last, be fully told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting verses from the Gnostic Apocalypse of James to the New Testament narrative showing that Judas was James in the Canonical Inversions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Apocalypse of James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;I have given you a sign&quot; (NHC 24:10) &quot;gave them a sign&quot; [the &quot;kiss&quot;]&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(Matt. 26:48).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Cup of bitterness to the sons of light&quot; (25:15) &quot;let this cup pass from me&quot;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(Matt. 26:39).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;This is the second Master&quot; (30:25) &quot;Those who seek enter through you&quot;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(Second Apoc. 55:1) &quot;I know whom I have chosen.&quot; (John 13:18).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Then the disciples dispersed, but James remained in prayer&quot; (30:25) &quot;he&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;withdrew and prayed&quot; (Luke 22:41).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am he who was within me&quot; (31:15) &quot;I know whom I have chosen&quot; and&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am he&quot; (John 13:18-19).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;You have embraced and kissed me&quot; (32:5) &quot;He said &#39;Hail Master!&#39; and&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;kissed him&quot; (Matt. 26:49).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;You are aware and stopped this prayer&quot; (32:5) &quot;Sit here while I pray&quot;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(Matt. 26:36).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;The flesh is weak&quot; (32:20) &quot;the flesh is weak&quot; (Matt. 26:41).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;It will receive what has been ordained for it&quot; (32:20) &quot;thy will be done&quot;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(Matt. 26:42).&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;A multitude will arm themselves against you&quot; (33:5) &quot;band of soldiers with&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;weapons&quot; (John 18:3, Mark 14:43).&lt;/br&gt;
