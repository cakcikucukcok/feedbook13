  <title>The Road Beneath My Feet - Frank Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In the fall    of 2005, Frank Turner was virtually unheard of. His rock band, Millions Dead,    was finishing up a grueling tour and had agreed that their show on September    23 would be their last. The entry on the band&#39;s schedule for September 24    read simply: &quot;Get a job.&quot;Cut to July 2012--the London Olympics,    where Turner and his backing band, The Sleeping Souls, are playing the    pre-show, after having headlined sold-out arena shows across the UK for    months.Â The Road Beneath My Feet is the unvarnished story of how Turner went from    crashing on couches at house shows to performing for thousands of screaming    fansÂ who roar his every lyric back at him.Â Told through  tour    reminiscences, this is a blisteringly honest tale of a rock career that&#39;s    taken Turner from drug-fuelled house parties and the grimy club scene to    international prominence and acclaim. But more than that, it is an intimate    account of what it&#39;s like to spend your life constantly on the road, sleeping    on floors, invariably jetlagged, all for the love of playing live music.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
