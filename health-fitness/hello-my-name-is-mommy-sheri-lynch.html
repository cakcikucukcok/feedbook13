  <title>Hello, My Name Is Mommy - Sheri Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hilarious and true and inspirational, &lt;i&gt;Hello, My Name is Mommy &lt;/i&gt;is for every pregnant woman and new mother who ever felt helpless and out of control instead of confident and aglow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, women know pregnancy is no bed of roses, but Lynch taps into her own dysfunctional childhood and fears about becoming a mom to label a much profounder worry many moms-to-be have: that their own pasts were so screwed up that they&#39;re doomed to repeat the cycle.  Dr. Spock may tell moms to trust their instincts, but Lynch&#39;s Misfit Mommies want to do every last thing but that. They feel like frauds and imposters, and Lynch&#39;s real-girl&#39;s voice will be instantly recognizable to them.  Lynch will walk and talk new moms through it all: from lamenting the hot dogs and second-hand smoke they were raised on (and, of course, &quot;you turned out just fine&quot;) to the realization that kids are kind of germy and gross (but feeling that way doesn&#39;t make one a bad mother) to keeping it together at work with Cheerios in the old nursing bra.&lt;/p&gt;" />
