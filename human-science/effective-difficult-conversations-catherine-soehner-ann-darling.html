  <title>Effective Difficult Conversations - Catherine Soehner, Ann Darling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an information landscape where change is the status quo, difficult conversations come with the territory. Being a library leader means knowing how to confidently steer these conversations so that they lead to productive results instead of hurt feelings, resentment, or worse.  Employees in a library will also encounter conflict, especially during times of change. Using a step-by-step process, this book walks readers through learning the skills to have effective difficult conversations that hold themselves and others accountable. Practice activities throughout the book will help readers feel prepared beforehand. After reading this book, library directors, managers, administrators, and team leaders will feel empowered to
    proactively identify situations that require an intervention in order to avoid unnecessary complications or confrontations down the line;
    prepare for and initiate a difficult conversation, balancing a clear message with compassion to successfully manage change or handle personnel issues;
    diffuse volatile emotions by maintaining a calm, measured approach;  and
    follow up a difficult conversation in writing, keeping the lines of communication open to ensure a way forward.
Illustrated with real-world examples of both successful and unsuccessful difficult conversations, this book will serve as an important leadership tool for handling change and conflicts in the library workplace." />
