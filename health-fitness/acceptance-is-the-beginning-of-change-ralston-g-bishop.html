  <title>Acceptance Is the Beginning of Change - Ralston G. Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The son of a single parent, a black Jamaican woman who was a poor domestic worker, author Ralston G. Bishop narrates the story of his life in &lt;i&gt;Acceptance is the Beginning of Change&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his birth in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, in 1974, to growing up poor in the parish of St Ann, to turning to crime, to spending time in prison, Bishop shares his journey and discusses the lessons hes learned along the way. Now a farmer and a poet, he reflects on poverty and its far-reaching effect on people, and he tells of the importance of having complete faith and trust in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From rags to riches and from riches to rags, this memoir shares Bishops story as he learns to accept the regrets of his past and come to terms with a new present and future. Honest and disclosing, &lt;i&gt;Acceptance is the Beginning of Change&lt;/i&gt; communicates that its not about what one lacks in life, it is about what one has. Its not about the mistakesits about the lessons gained.&lt;/p&gt;" />
