  <title>Musings of a Blogger - Ruth Anne Caukwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Great read. Excellently written. Workbook included. Good price&quot; Kathy Joliene&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Musings of a Blogger: Inspirational Thoughts for Your Life&#39;s Journey speaks with a voice of courage and a spirit of discovery as it reveals the musings of a woman who has devoted her life to personal improvement through education, reflection, and transformation. The author, Ruth Anne Caukwell, entwines a collection of inspirational thoughts with a sequence of workbook entries. By spending time sharing the musings and then reviewing one&#39;s own life, the reader of this guide for life&#39;s journey can set out with determination to discover life&#39;s deep truths.&lt;P&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Musings of a Blogger shares the story of a boy who sees a butterfly struggling to emerge from its chrysalis. Desiring to help it, he releases the butterfly, only to discover that the struggle to break free is what gives strength to the butterfly&#39;s wings. Absent the struggle, the butterfly is too weak to fl y. The workbook gives shape to one&#39;s struggle, serving to build strength so that one may fl y gloriously like a healthy butterfly.&lt;P&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;By sharing this journey with the author, you can discover the truth about your own life and the source of your strength. As she writes, &quot;Walking alongside others instead of totally relying on them allows you to become strengthened. It allows you to become who you really are, able to find your authentic self and fl y free. It allows you to be who you were meant to be!&quot;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/i&gt;" />
