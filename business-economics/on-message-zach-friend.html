  <title>On Message - Zach Friend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In this era of information overload and real-time communication where anyone can publish and broadcast to millions of people with the click of a button, there is no shortage of people talking about the need to get their message across, or having a &amp;#8220;narrative.&amp;#8221; But for business, marketing, and political campaigns, there is no definitive how-to on crafting a compelling narrative that achieves lasting results. And without a narrative, no amount of framing, complex messaging, or facts will succeed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;On Message&lt;/I&gt; solves that problem, illustrating how effective communicators understand the power of narrative, emotion, and simple messaging, and posits that having a personal, emotional narrative is the basis for all successful communication.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on Zach Friend&amp;#8217;s own experience and insights from politics, advertising, corporate communications, entertainment, and social psychology, &lt;I&gt;On Message &lt;/I&gt;provides a simple process for applying the powerful principles behind crafting a narrative, ultimately paving the path to success. Specifically, readers will:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Learn how to focus their communication efforts in a dramatically more powerful way on the most important factor, narrative;&lt;BR&gt;-Master the mindset needed to become a better communicator and make a forceful impact on their audience and clients;&lt;BR&gt;-Stop wasting time and energy gathering unnecessary facts and data that don&amp;#8217;t advance their message; and&lt;BR&gt;-Get results faster by using narrative as a productive tool that will fuel success.&lt;/div&gt;" />
