  <title>Building Jerusalem - Tristram Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Manchester&#39;s deadly cotton works to London&#39;s literary salons, a brilliant exploration of how the Victorians created the modern city&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Since Charles Dickens first described Coketown in &lt;i&gt;Hard Times&lt;/i&gt;, the nineteenth-century city, born of the industrial revolution, has been a byword for deprivation, pollution, and criminality. Yet, as historian Tristram Hunt argues in this powerful new history, the Coketowns of the 1800s were far more than a monstrous landscape of factories and tenements. By 1851, more than half of Britain&#39;s population lived in cities, and even as these pioneers confronted a frightening new way of life, they produced an urban flowering that would influence the shape of cities for generations to come. &lt;br&gt;     Drawing on diaries, newspapers, and classic works of fiction, Hunt shows how the Victorians translated their energy and ambition into realizing an astonishingly grand vision of the utopian city on a hill--the new Jerusalem. He surveys the great civic creations, from town halls to city squares, sidewalks, and even sewers, to reveal a story of middle-class power and prosperity and the liberating mission of city life. Vowing to emulate the city-states of Renaissance Italy, the Victorians worked to turn even the smokestacks of Manchester and Birmingham into sites of freedom and art. And they succeeded--until twentieth-century decline transformed wealthy metropolises into dangerous inner cities. &lt;br&gt;     An original history of proud cities and confident citizens, &lt;i&gt;Building Jerusalem&lt;/i&gt; depicts an unrivaled era that produced one of the great urban civilizations of Western history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
