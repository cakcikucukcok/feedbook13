  <title>Los Pingüinos/ the Penguins - Aracely De Alvarado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Penguins are birds that live in places where its very cold, some live in the Arctic Circle, and others cannot live in such extreme temperatures and live in warmer coastal regions or islands.
Due to global warming, penguins are suffering; fortunately there are people who are professionally trained to deal with this pressing issue. We should cooperate so that this beautiful species does not become extinct and the children of the future may have the joy of knowing them.
Aracely De Alvarado is a former preschool teacher that wishes for children to discover the wonderful animal life that exists on the land, in the oceans, jungles, vast plains, freezing tundras and hot deserts.
I have always considered penguins beautiful and mysterious creatures; and I wrote this story because they have always been a source of inspiration for me. I hope this story motivates children to learn and discover the amazing and wonderful environment of these beautiful and amazing birds.
This story is dedicated to my beloved grandchildren Kylie Jade and Conrad Zane Alvarado." />
