  <title>Never-ending-snake - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a people, the Navajo seek to walk in beauty and find a balance between modern and traditional culture. As a mother, a daughter, and a member of the Navajo Nation, Ella Clah finds her own way to walk--but as a police officer, she seeks both justice and truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;i&gt;Never-ending-snake&lt;/i&gt; begins, Ella is returning from a trip to Washington, DC, where she has been presented with a lucrative offer of employment with a private security firm. The catch? She would have to leave the Reservation. And while Ella has lived off the Rez before, it would be a life-altering experience for her daughter, Dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Ella has a chance to even begin making up her mind, gunfire sends her and her companions diving for cover. Who is the target? War hero and alternative fuel lobbyist Adam Lonewolf, politician and tribal attorney Kevin Tolino, or Ella herself? As a Navajo Police Special Investigator, Ella has made more than one enemy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
