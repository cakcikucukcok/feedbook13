  <title>&quot;Just Lassen to Me!&quot;: A First-Generation Son&#39;s Story: Surviving a Survivor - Harvy Simkovits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it possible to admire a man&#39;s accomplishments but abhor what he stands for, to seek his blessing but spurn his legacy? What if that man is your father? John Simkovits, a native of Czechoslovakia, survived the ravages of World War II before immigrating to Canada to escape the onset of Soviet Communism. Over the next thirty years, he grew a business and real estate empire through corporate double-dealing, devious tax evading, and offshore money stashing-flitting from one tax dodge and haven to the next. Johnny groomed his second son, Harvy, to be the heir of his fortune, enticing him into a world of questionable deals and backroom chicanery. Unlike his religious brother and embittered mother, Harvy was drawn to his father&#39;s shrewd business savvy and listened to his advice, which often began with, &quot;Just lassen [listen] to me!&quot; Harvy faces hard choices and undergoes shattering life changes to reconcile, repudiate, and rectify his father&#39;s dubious legacy." />
