  <title>Secession - Melvin Bielawski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Secession &lt;/I&gt;is a thrilling novel of a special group of Americans who take advantage of the serious divisions existing in the United States to organize and plan to target one of the States to secede from the Union in the 21&lt;SUP&gt;st&lt;/SUP&gt; Century. The events that take place shock the nation and the world.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The millions of new immigrants in the country in the later part of the 20&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; Century, the major religious and political differences on the issue of abortion versus the right to life, the issue of gun control, the increase in animosities between racial and various ethnic groups, and the growing disenchantment of the American people with the two major political parties lead to major unrest in many segments of the nation. New and radical political parties are organized. A group within one political party decides to take dramatic action. The group establishes a secret committee for this action. The committee in turn designates a special working team to develop the detailed strategy and plan for selecting one State for secession from the United States. The team, working at a special site that they believe friendly to their cause, develops the modus operandi for this unprecedented action. The team, after reviewing all of the United States, develops the plan to include the recommended State to be targeted for secession, the rationale for its selection, and a series of actions to assure success of the action.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The results of the committee are surprising. The plan developed is approved for implementation. The nation is shaken by the events that unfold. The reader is kept spellbound from the beginning to the end of this shocking drama.&lt;/P&gt;
