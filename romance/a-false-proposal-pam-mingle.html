  <title>A False Proposal - Pam Mingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;London 1812.&lt;/i&gt; War hero Adam Grey returns home with a burning ambition to run for Parliament. But he needs the support of the local baronet, who controls the seat. Adam&#39;s plans are thwarted by his dissolute father, who has promised him to the baronet&#39;s daughter in return for forgiveness of his debts. Adam wants nothing to do with marriage or his father&#39;s problems, so he fakes an engagement to Cass Linford--his best friend&#39;s sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cass has been through hell since she last saw Adam. Her betrothed committed suicide, forcing her to withdraw from London society. Heartbroken, she&#39;s given up on marriage. So when Adam suggests a temporary engagement, she agrees. He needs help with his campaign, and Cass can&#39;t resist his charm or the chance to be involved in politics. It all seems so easy, until she finds herself falling in love with her fake fiancé.&lt;/p&gt;" />
