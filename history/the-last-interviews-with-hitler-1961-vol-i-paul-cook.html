  <title>The Last Interviews with Hitler:  1961-Vol I - Paul Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;  Paul Cook- historian, author of Siege at the White House and European resident for many years has written the first bombshell of a World War II series that is destined to become a classic. Partially based on personal experiences, declassified secret documents and historical research that is guaranteed to upset the status quo, Mr. Cook takes us back to Germany of the late 1960s to when he was a member of the United States Air Force and met a young German woman. As Paul becomes more involved with his new love and her family, he discovers a secret from her father that he carries until now. Adolf Hitler survived the war and fooled the Soviets concerning his proposed suicide. &lt;P&gt;  Included with his story of why Mr. Cook has sit on this explosive powder keg of information for so many decades are the first four interviews with the onetime German head of state smuggled out of Europe. Some of the startling revelations by the former Fuhrer are: How he faked his suicide and where did he escape to in 1945? His post war revelations of Himmler, Goering, Hess, Churchill, FDR, Eisenhower, Truman and JFK that are very enlightening and prophetic. He tells us what really happened to the Hindenburg and it is not what you thought. His comments on the Holocaust and Jews in general as well as revealing American Communist spies in high places are just a few of the more than eighty explosive topics covered. &lt;P&gt;  This is war, as you have never imagined. It is filled with romance, hate, murder, political intrigue and international high drama and that is before you get to the interviews with Hitler. The Last Interviews with Hitler: 1961  Vol. I is a book that the victors of WWII never wanted published. Erase what you have learned about World War II, for this thriller gives you enough thought provoking exciting twists and turns to last a lifetime.&lt;/P&gt;" />
