  <title>The Cave of Mystery - Robert F. Boeck, Robert M. Crum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    A hidden cave on an old gravel road, a jacket pulled up on an anchor, and a persistent twelve-year-old boy provide the backdrop for a mystery for all ages.
    Can Sam Small overcome the doubts of his own father and the rejection of a Michigan sheriff? In trying to solve a mystery, Sam puts himself in jeopardy
    when grabbed by a cruel kidnapper.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    A family vacation in the Northwoods, camping out, fishing and a lost ball are the backdrop of a mystery that recalls a simpler and more wholesome time.
    Like a bedtime story told by a grandparent, experience a little piece of childhood again.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Early readers are looking for good chapter books to read. This mystery would be a great choice because of its great storyline and Christian Life and World
    View. I fully recommend it for my grandchildren.
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    The Cave of Mystery is a book for all ages. Fascinating, engaging, and compelling; the opening paragraphs draw the reader in immediately and soon you find
    yourself trying to unlock the mystery and solve the case. The author skillfully weaves those historic values and biblical principles into a story filled
    endlessly with drama and suspense-all the way to the last page. My ten year old grandson, who loves spy gear and mysteries, was captivated by it. A great
    read for any age, especially boys looking for adventure.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    The Cave of Mystery is a wonderful story for the whole family. The characters come alive. Theres mystery, perseverance and excitement. Woven into this
    book are lessons that show how you live your life can have a big influence on others. Frankly, I couldnt put the book down.
