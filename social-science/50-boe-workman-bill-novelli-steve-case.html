  <title>50+ - Boe Workman, Bill Novelli, Steve Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;50+&lt;/i&gt; is a call to arms. It&#39;s a groundbreaking look at the revolution that&#39;s going on right now among seventy-eight million American baby boomers. From age 50+ on up, Americans are refusing to rock away their retirement. They&#39;re starting new careers, rallying for causes close to their hearts, raising grandchildren, becoming more active in their communities, and, above all else, changing the face of aging in America.     &lt;br&gt;        Bill Novelli, CEO of AARP, knows that with the largest generation of Americans ever recorded nearing traditional retirement age, this revolution is changing the way 50+ Americans live their lives. The boomers have vast technological expertise, are actively involved in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, have been politically active throughout their lives, and are comfortable managing their own finances. They&#39;re no strangers to the gym, the voting booth, online investing sites, or the day-to-day management of their 401(k)s, and they&#39;re joining an already active and savvy group of Americans 50+ and beyond who are determined to leave their mark on the world. Novelli knows that there&#39;s strength in numbers and that 50+ Americans can seize the day by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Working to transform health care not only by demanding quality care and lower pharmaceutical costs, but also by engaging in healthy lifestyles and preventive care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Creating a secure retirement by planning personal finances well in advance and working to make Social Security solvent for all Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Revolutionizing the workplace so those of us who want or need to continue working can do so in a way that benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Building livable communities with improved housing, transportation, and services, allowing all Americans to age in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Changing the marketplace by driving the development of innovative products and services that add value to 50+ lives, and using collective purchasing power to make them affordable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Advocating for causes that will really make a difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Creating a lasting legacy so we can leave the world a better place than we found it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By discovering the possibilities that lie within all of us, we can ignite a twenty-first-century revolution to make America better and stronger. If you&#39;re 50+, Bill Novelli has a message for you: The best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
