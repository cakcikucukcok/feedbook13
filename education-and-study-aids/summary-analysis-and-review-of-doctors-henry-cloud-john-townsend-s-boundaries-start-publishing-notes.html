  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Doctors Henry Cloud &amp; John Townsend’s Boundaries - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Doctors Henry Cloud &amp; John Townsend’s Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life
includes a summary of the book, a review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and a detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Boundaries is a self-help book with Christian inspirational components by Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, a pair of authors and psychologists in California. The book is written in the first-person, although neither of the doctors are named in the text; the pair of them seem to share this point of view. This book is primarily concerned with psychological and spiritual boundaries, particularly how to establish them and how to rebuild them when they are violated. It provides examples of common types of boundary conflicts as well as advice on how to resolve those conflicts.
Cloud and Townsend open Boundaries with a day in the life of an overworked and underappreciated woman named Sherrie. Sherrie is stressed, taking on too many responsibilities from her family, friends, co-workers, and church members. Her son is uncontrollable in his third grade class, her six-year-old daughter is withdrawn and uncommunicative, her husband is distant, and her boss surprises her with last-minute assignments. Sherrie is both exhausted by her workload and guilty that she cannot do more.
At this point, Cloud and Townsend transition into the first part of their book, which focuses on what boundaries are." />
