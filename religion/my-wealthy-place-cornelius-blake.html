  <title>My Wealthy Place - Cornelius Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hi, if you are looking for a get rich quick scheme this is not the right book for you. But if you are sick and tired of being broke, and are filled with the wonder of success you are holding the right book in your hands. In My Wealthy Place, Bishop Cornelius Blake shares his thoughts on wealth. He argues that wealth is a gift from the almighty to humanity, to be used for the establishment of His kingdom and the good of your fellow man here on earth. He argues that wealth is not something you pursue, rather, it is something you attract by the kind of person you have become. Masterfully intertwined in the nuances of Scriptures, he paints a legible path to your desired Wealthy Place. In MWP, youll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Develop a biblical mindset regarding wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Acquire and hold on to your wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Tap into your wealth creating talents/abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Wipe-out the enemies of wealth creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Be promoted by the anointing to your wealthy place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Increase your value to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Climb the wealth Ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 Navigate the phases of faith to your desired Wealthy Place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
