  <title>Black Rose Days - Martin Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He beat her. Broke skin, left her needing stitches, and begged his sister to furnish him with an alibi. My husband. What on earth have I married? A dormant monster?’ 
Secrets, once disturbed, can ruin a life that has been spent trying to hide them. 
Two voices – one living, one dead – compete to find the truth behind the unsolved murder of Ena Tierney, committed thirty-one years ago on the Curragh Plains. Dan Somers, Ena’s husband and the chief suspect at the time of the murder, returns to Ireland in an attempt to clear his name once and for all and uncover what has been left hidden for far too long. 
As Dan learns of the events surrounding Ena’s death, a great turbulence roars to life that will consume everything – and everyone – in its path. 
A gripping and disturbing mystery, this is the latest powerful work by Martin Malone, one of Ireland’s finest storytellers." />
