  <title>Still Burning - Alinda Dickinson Wasner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wasner speaks passionately, unabashedly, and with humor about love, physical and spiritual, about the cycles of the seasons and generations. Hers are poems of conscience about hard work and circumstances. Her eye is finely attuned to the tiny details as well as the wild juxtapositions that make up our world. She helps us see it anew.
 --Anca Vlasopolos, Walking Toward Solstice
Alinda Wasners poetry sends you over a Niagara of images in a barrel of wonder. And you experience a thrilling ride and a surprising drop, for you never know, when you start, just where shes going to leave you when you splash down at the bottom. The most seemingly innocent beginnings lead to delicious naughty ends. An innocuous start finishes with a poignant detour into the deepest recesses of the heart. Startled to discover where you end up, you know thats where youre supposed to be. 
 --Anthony Ambrogio, Assoc. Editor, Corridors
&quot;With craft and insight, Alinda Wasner&#39;s poems explore the stuff of life -- love and loss, dancing at long-ago celebrations, kisses under the summer sun, and memories as pale as the moon at dawn.&quot;
	--John Gallagher, The Detroit Free Press and author of Reimagining Detroit.
Alinda Wasner&#39;s poetry collection wonderfully and honestly captures how helpless we are before our passions, whether it&#39;s a reconciling couple and their love noises muffled by the shrieks of a jay(&quot;Ode to the night and morning following an All-Day of Arguing&quot;), a bittersweet visit to a broken-down home in an old neighborhood (Gone) or a truly beautiful solo of a grandmother braving a blizzard to welcome her newborn grandson into the world (&quot;Aria&quot;)--Still Burning is a vivid songbook of loss and desire.  ---                 
                                          -- Patrick O&#39;Leary, The Gift." />
