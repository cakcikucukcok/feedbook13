  <title>David Suzuki: The Autobiography - David Suzuki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;David Suzuki&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#8217;s autobiography limns a life dedicated to making the world a better place. The book expands on the early years covered in &lt;I&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/I&gt; and continues to the present, when, at age 70, Suzuki reflects on his entire life &amp;#151; and his hopes for the future. The book begins with his life-changing experience of racism interned in a World War II concentration camp, and goes on to discuss his teenage years, his college and postgraduate experiences in the U.S., and his career as a geneticist and then as the host of The Nature of Things. With characteristic candor and passion, he describes how he became a leading environmentalist, writer, and thinker; the establishment of the David Suzuki Foundation; his world travels and meetings with luminaries like Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama; and the abiding role of nature and family in his life. &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;David Suzuki&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is an intimate and inspiring look at a modern-day visionary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
