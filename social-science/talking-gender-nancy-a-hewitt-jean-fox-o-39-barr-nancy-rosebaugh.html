  <title>Talking Gender - Nancy A. Hewitt, Jean Fox O&#39;Barr, Nancy Rosebaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Talking Gender&lt;/i&gt; assesses the state of women&#39;s studies in the 1990s. The contributors write from the perspective of their own academic disciplines and experiences, but they also address more general issues of women&#39;s lives and circumstances. The result is a broad picture of women&#39;s studies and feminist scholarship, which emerge as a rich, if sometimes dissonant, chorus of voices.      These original essays cover a range of topics and a variety of times and places: images of women inherited from Roman oratory, visual images from cultures of trauma; verbal imagery in today&#39;s pornography debates; political and social identities in the state of Israel; boundaries between private and public lives of African American women leaders; voices and audiences of African American women writers; stereotypes of HIV-positive women; what women&#39;s studies can teach men about themselves; and the place of women in global industry. The introduction and conclusion place the collection within the context of historical debates in women&#39;s studies and suggest some new directions for the field.
