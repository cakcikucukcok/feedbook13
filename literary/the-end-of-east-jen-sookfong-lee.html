  <title>The End of East - Jen Sookfong Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the tradition of Amy Tan and Jhumpa Lahiri, a moving portrait of three generations of family living in Vancouver&#39;s Chinatown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Knopf Canada&#39;s New Face of Fiction program--launching grounds for Yann Martel&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Life of Pi&lt;/i&gt; and Ann-Marie MacDonald&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fall on Your Knees&lt;/i&gt;--comes this powerfully evocative novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age eighteen, Seid Quan is the first in the Chan family to emigrate from China to Vancover in 1913. Paving the way for a wife and son, he is profoundly lonely, even as he joins the Chinatown community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving in and out of the past and the present, &lt;i&gt;The End of East&lt;/i&gt; pieces together the spellbinding tale of Seid Quan&#39;s family: his wife Shew Lin, whose hope for her family are threatened by her own misguided actions; his son Pon Man, who struggles with obligation and desire; his daughter-in-law Siu Sang, who tries to be the caregiver everyone expects, even as she feels herself unraveling; and his granddaughter Sammy, who finds herself embroiled in a volatile mixture of seduction, grief, and duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exquisite debut of isolation, immigration, romance, and insanity, &lt;i&gt;The End of East&lt;/i&gt; sets family conflicts against the backdrop of Vancouver&#39;s Chinatown--a city within a city where dreams are shattered as quickly as they&#39;re built, and where history repeats itself through the generations. It is a bold and accomplished debut from one of Canada&#39;s brightest new literary stars.&lt;/p&gt;" />
