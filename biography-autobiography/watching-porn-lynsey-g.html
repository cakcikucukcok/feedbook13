  <title>Watching Porn - Lynsey G</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Lynsey G. never imagined that she would ever work in porn, but at 24 years old, with a degree  in English literature and an empty bank account, she found herself reviewing the film East Coast  ASSault for an adult magazine in New York City. One interview later and it was official: she was a porn  journalist. The job was supposed to be temporary--just a paycheck until she could spark her legitimate  writing career--but she loved it and spent nearly a decade describing the nuances of money shots and  the effectiveness of sex toys. As both a porn consumer and a porn critic, she was not quite an insider,  not quite an outsider, but came to know the industry intimately.She found it so fascinating that she co-founded WHACK! Magazine. Finally, she had a platform to  voice her thoughts and observations of the adult film world, as well as educate the rest of us about  what really goes on behind the scenes.Â Eventually, Lynsey was thrust back into the &quot;real+? world, but not  before realizing that one of the most diverse and nebulous--and profitable--industries on the planet  isn&#39;t so quite as different from the rest of the world as she thought.  Tantalizing, eye-opening, and witty, Watching Porn is a provocative book about an average girl&#39;s  foray into the porn industry and the people who make it what it is, both in front of and behind the camera.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
