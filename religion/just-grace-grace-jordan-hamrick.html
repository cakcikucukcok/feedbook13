  <title>Just Grace - Grace Jordan Hamrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Grace: The Transforming Power of Gods Amazing Grace in the Life of an Ordinary Woman&lt;/i&gt; is Grace Hamricks story. A foolish decision made as a teenager had a devastating effect on her and an all-consuming guilt was destroying her, eventually putting her on a self-destructive path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir is a story of graceGods incredible, redeeming grace that rescued her. She describes how she came to realize her deep need for Gods grace through some of the heart-wrenching circumstances of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where there is much pain and suffering, and it is easy to feel like there is no hope, no future, no way of ever changing. But there is hope; and God can and does change people. There is no sin so great He cannot forgive; there is no life so messed up He cannot restore. There is no person so broken that He cannot mend. No one is ever beyond the reach of Gods mercy and grace. Grace Hamrick is living proof it is never too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
