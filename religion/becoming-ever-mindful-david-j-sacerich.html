  <title>Becoming Ever Mindful - David J. Sacerich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you getting tired of seeing your hopes and dreams slip through your hands?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Have you lost your focus and forgotten who God called you to be? 
Do you feel that you are stuck in a rut and are just slowly drifting through life?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There were many characters in the Bible that went through those same situations. We will explore those stories in this book and you will learn simple steps which will help reshape your vision for your life. I believe that when you become aware of Gods vision for you personally and His word for you in each moment of your day, you will be able to take back your dreams.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gods word says in Romans 1:20 (NIV) that For since the creation of the world Gods invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Discovering Gods will for your life should not be some difficult mystery. Gods Word clearly states that He desires to be close to you and to be your guide.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If youve lost your hope and zeal for life; if youre ready to be an overcomer, if youre ready to rediscover an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ, then join me on this journey of Becoming Ever Mindful!&lt;/p&gt;" />
