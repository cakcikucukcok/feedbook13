  <title>In the Name of Democracy - Jeremy Brecher, Jill Cutler, Brendan Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A riveting documentary anthology that examines a deeply disturbing question: Is the United States guilty of war crimes in Iraq?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the possibility that the United States was responsible for war crimes seemed unthinkable to most Americans. But as previously suppressed information has started to emerge--photographs from Abu Ghraib; accounts of U.S. attacks on Iraqi hospitals, mosques, and residential neighborhoods; secret government reports defending unilateral aggression--Americans have begun an agonizing reappraisal of the Iraq war and the way in which their government has conducted it. &lt;br&gt;Drawing on a wide range of documents--from the protocols of the Geneva Convention to FBI e-mails about prisoners held in Guantánamo Bay to executive-branch papers justifying the circumvention of international law--In the Name of Democracy examines the legality of the Iraq war and the occupation that followed. Included in this powerful investigation are eyewitness accounts, victim testimonials, statements by soldiers turned resisters and whistle-blowers, interviews with intelligence insiders, and contributions by Mark Danner and Seymour Hersh. &lt;br&gt;The result is a controversial, chilling anthology that explores the culpability of officials as well as the responsibilities of ordinary citizens, and for the first time squarely confronts the matter of American impunity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
