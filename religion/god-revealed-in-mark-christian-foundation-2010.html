  <title>God Revealed in Mark - Christian Foundation 2010</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first time in 2,000 years, this book analyzes the Gospel of Mark and unveils the historical Jesus, His identity, and image of God. All words, parables, and miracle stories are decoded and interpreted, and all unheard-of facts and truths are disclosed. It is revealed that Peter was a sinner in the village of sinners; that Peter, James, John, and Andrew were not fisherman, but were spiritual fisherman who preached to the suffering people of the village of sinners and harvested the holy spirit from them; that Jesus saved one thousand men by preaching 10-20 times at the villages of sinners for three years; that Jesus cleared the temple spiritually, not physically, with his Word; that Jesus&#39; Passover meal was not the mutton but the word and holy spirit; and that the God&#39;s last judgment was concluded in AD 70.   
These facts are disclosed when the scriptures are read in spiritual language. 
It turns out that the four Gospels  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John  have never been interpreted correctly. As a result, Christianity has lost Jesus for nearly 2,000 years and follows the path of ruin. Now it is revealed that the Gospel of Mark contains astonishing revelations and good news which will rescue Christianity from extinction and lead all mankind to God. 
This book speaks to Biblical scholars, Christians who worry about the corruption of churches and extinction of Christianity, and those who want to receive the Holy Spirit and meet Jesus and God." />
