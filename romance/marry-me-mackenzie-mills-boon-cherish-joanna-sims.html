          &lt;strong&gt;Daddy, Revealed&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a decade, Mackenzie Brand had kept her daughter’s paternity a secret. Then she unexpectedly ran into Dylan Axel, and the single mom knew there was no more hiding. Hope’s greatest wish was to meet her father. And when Dylan got a look at the beautiful ten-year-old he simply knew she was his. But he didn’t know everything….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With Hope battling a terrible illness, Mackenzie needed all the support she could get. Dylan vowed to be there for them both and promised Mackenzie she could lean on him. But she was no longer the bookish girl enamoured of the dashing boy next door. Giving herself to Dylan this time meant going all in. This was their second chance. Was she brave enough to take it?&lt;/p&gt;
