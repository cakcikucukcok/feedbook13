  <title>Nate&#39;s Quest - Asa M. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young Natalie is not your typical farmer&#39;s daughter.   Ever since the day of her birth, her father has thought of her as a boy, and he&#39;s treated her just like he might treat a son. At six, Nate (as she prefers to be called) is already resilient, strong, and even stubborn at times. She&#39;s also impressively independent and surprisingly shrewd, traits that will serve her well in life. As a child of the Appalachian Hills of Pennsylvania, she is by nature guarded, but she is also blessed with a strong work ethic. Above all, she is smart.   As she grows and her life leads her away from the farm, Nate begins to discover who she really is. A student of engineering with dreams of entrepreneurial freedom, she thinks she has it all figured out. The problem is-life has other ideas. Tested to her limits on more than one occasion, she has quite the adventure ahead of her, a bumpy and unforgettable journey from the farm to the boardroom.  Come hell or high water, she&#39;ll find a way to make her dreams come true." />
