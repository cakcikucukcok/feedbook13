But when he&amp;#8217;s ambushed and almost killed, his supervisor is determined to find out who&amp;#8217;s after the members of his elite squad&amp;#8212;and why. Due to worries that this unknown enemy will strike again, Morgan is sent to a remote location and told to lay low and stay vigilant. But between a tempting housemate he&amp;#8217;s determined to protect and a deadly threat waiting in the shadows, keeping under the radar is proving to be his most dangerous mission yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The part-time police chief of a small West Virginian mountain town, Isabeau &amp;#8220;Bo&amp;#8221; Maran finally has her life figured out. She&amp;#8217;s got friends, a dog, and a little money in the bank. Then Morgan Yancy shows up on her doorstep. Bo doesn&amp;#8217;t need a mysterious man in her life&amp;#8212;especially a troublemaker as enticing and secretive as Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harder they fight the intense heat between them, the closer Morgan and Bo become, even though she knows he&amp;#8217;s hiding from something. But discovering the truth could cost Bo more than she&amp;#8217;s willing to give. And when Morgan&amp;#8217;s cover is blown, it might just cost her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
