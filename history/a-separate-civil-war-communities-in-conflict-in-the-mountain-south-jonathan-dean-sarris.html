  <title>A Separate Civil War: Communities in Conflict in the Mountain South - Jonathan Dean Sarris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most Americans think of the Civil War as a series of dramatic clashes between     massive armies led by romantic-seeming leaders. But in the Appalachian communities of North     Georgia, things were very different. Focusing on Fannin and Lumpkin counties in the Blue Ridge     Mountains along Georgia&#39;s northern border, A Separate Civil War: Communities in Conflict     in the Mountain South argues for a more localized, idiosyncratic understanding of this momentous     period in our nation&#39;s history. The book reveals that, for many participants, this war was     fought less for abstract ideological causes than for reasons tied to home, family, friends, and     community.&lt;p&gt;Making use of a large trove of letters, diaries, interviews, government     documents, and sociological data, Jonathan Dean Sarris brings to life a previously obscured     version of our nation&#39;s most divisive and destructive war. From the outset, the prospect     of secession and war divided Georgia&#39;s mountain communities along the lines of race and     religion, and war itself only heightened these tensions. As the Confederate government began to     draft men into the army and seize supplies from farmers, many mountaineers became more     disaffected still. They banded together in armed squads, fighting off Confederate soldiers,     state militia, and their own pro-Confederate neighbors. A local civil war ensued, with each side     seeing the other as a threat to law, order, and community itself. In this very personal     conflict, both factions came to dehumanize their enemies and use methods that shocked even     seasoned soldiers with their savagery. But when the war was over in 1865, each faction sought to     sanitize the past and integrate its stories into the national myths later popularized about the     Civil War. By arguing that the reason for choosing sides had more to do with local concerns than     with competing ideologies or social or political visions, Sarris adds a much-needed complication     to the question of why men fought in the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
