  <title>Gift Wrapped - Peter Turnbull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When four postcards are sent anonymously to the staff of an advice centre, each with the word &#39;murder&#39; scribbled in a foreign language and the same precise OS map reference, the police are called. DCI Hennessey of the Vale of York police and his team of detectives visit the sinister location and make a chilling discovery: the body of a professional man who had been reported missing ten years earlier. Who sent the postcards, and why so long after the crime? As Hennessey and his team investigate - uncovering more past murders, a case of local authority corruption and two manipulative wives keen to gift-wrap their husbands as murderers in order to benefit financially from their estates - they find themselves drawn into a puzzling and dangerous investigation." />
