  <title>Sugar Free, Gluten Free and Preservative Free Kiss Method of Cooking - Sandy Koutalis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The journey of writing cook books began in 2009, I was encouraged to scribe the recipes as they were simple and delicious. Keep it simple sweetheart was just a flow on from the first book, where I used a lot of recipes that my mother always used, yet I had to convert from Imperial measurements, Fahrenheit temperatures to metric measurements and centigrade temperatures. I now know that 1 ounce of butter is 33 g of butter or one of my finger widths. I placed my personal twist to these recipes. I also added some favourites of mine. It is amazing what you learn on the cooking journey as I am sure that you will discover! Have an excellent time creating fare to tantalize your taste buds." />
