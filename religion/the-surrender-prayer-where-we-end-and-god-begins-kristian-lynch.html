  <title>The Surrender Prayer: Where We End and God Begins - Kristian Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;YOU&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Christians doubt the legitimacy of their salvation because they still struggle with the same hurts and destructive behaviors that they suffered from before they were saved. They wrestle with their belief in the power of Jesus Christ because the pain of past trauma, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex, or pornography is still very present in their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I hear from the Christians who come to me for help:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I go to church every Sunday and attend weekday services. I&amp;rsquo;m a member of a small group. I read my Bible and pray every day. I&amp;rsquo;m doing everything the pastor told me to do.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;ve confessed the sin. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to live my life right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep on feeling like a failure or a disappointment to God. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep on doing the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing! I believed that God would heal me when I got saved. I believed that he would take this pain from me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I just get over it? Why do I feel so alone and afraid? Why do I feel so ashamed&amp;mdash;so different from everyone around me? What am I doing wrong? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t God love me? Why isn&amp;rsquo;t God helping me? Is God even real?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you identify with any of these sentiments, you are not alone. You&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for answers to your questions and hoping to be healed. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I want you to know: God does care, and you will find the answers you seek when you learn how to stop fighting your battles in your own strength. The Surrender Prayer is a practical guide that will show you how to overcome your struggles by surrendering them to God, which will enable you to begin fighting in God&amp;rsquo;s power &amp;ndash; not your own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
