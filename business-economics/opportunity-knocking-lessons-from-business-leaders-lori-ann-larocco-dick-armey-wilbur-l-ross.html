  <title>Opportunity Knocking: Lessons from Business Leaders - Lori Ann LaRocco, Dick Armey, Wilbur L. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Known as the producer with the trillion-dollar Rolodex, Lori Ann LaRocco knows how to get business leaders and entrepreneurs to talk. Many of the world&amp;#8217;s most well-known executives are so trusting of LaRocco, senior talent producer at CNBC, that she consistently gets scoops on billion-dollar deals before anyone else. In her newest book, &lt;I&gt;Opportunity Knocking&lt;/I&gt;, LaRocco uses her close relationships with these organizational leaders to tell their stories&amp;#151;many of which have never been previously revealed, but offer brilliant insights into their minds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Opportunity Knocking&lt;/I&gt;, readers will learn the full stories and secrets of success from some of the world&#39;s smartest, most innovative leaders, such as Ford CEO Alan Mulally&amp;#8217;s strategy for creating a culture of promise that revitalized the American auto industry. This book provides real-world examples from leaders like Mulally and turns them into actionable, proven strategies for identifying and acting on opportunities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What makes &lt;I&gt;Opportunity Knocking&lt;/I&gt; stand apart is the diversity of individuals who offer real-world strategies and advice instead of just one person&amp;#8217;s opinion or vision. From the assembly line to the C-suite, &lt;I&gt;Opportunity Knocking&lt;/I&gt; will provide both inspiration and a blueprint for achieving success by recognizing the right opportunity&amp;#151;and seizing it.&lt;/div&gt;" />
