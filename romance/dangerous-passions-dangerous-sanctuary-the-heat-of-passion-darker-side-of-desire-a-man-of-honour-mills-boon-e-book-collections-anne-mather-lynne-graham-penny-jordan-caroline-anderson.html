          &lt;strong&gt;Dangerous Passions – four phenomenal classic, passionate novels from four absolute queens of romance&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DANGEROUS SANCTUARY by Anne Mather&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is it pure coincidence that Ben Russell has chosen to buy the old Priory? Surely it couldn’t be anything to do with Jaime or her teenage son, Tom! It had been fifteen years since she’d seen her ex-husband’s brother. Now his nearness was threatening to destroy all her hard-won independence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaime desperately wants to escape from the sensual strength of his hands and rekindle the hatred she knew she should feel towards him – but she can’t! Ben has come to claim the woman he had always loved, and the son he’d never known…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE HEAT OF PASSION by Lynne Graham&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the prospect of being Carlo Saracini&#39;s mistress was too hot for Jessica to handle, so she opted for the safety of marriage to another man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now Jessica is a widow and faced with the unthinkable: she needs Carlo&#39;s help or her father will go to jail!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carlo proposes a deal that will give him what he’s always wanted—Jessica at his mercy and naked in his bed! But letting Carlo possess her body and soul will be to give him the ultimate revenge and reveal her innocence…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DARKER SIDE OF DESIRE by Penny Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A link had been forged the day Claire saved the heir to the desert kingdom of Omarah from assassins. Otherwise, she wouldn&#39;t have agreed to masquerade as the infant&#39;s mother - and Raoul D&#39;Albro&#39;s unwanted wife. Raoul was prejudiced against Claire. And as long as his eyes burned with contempt for her, Claire felt shielded from his powerful masculinity…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A MAN OF HONOUR by Caroline Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Helen Cooper is sincerely puzzled. She knows exactly how she feels about the new senior surgical registrar, Dr Tom Russell, and at times she thinks her feelings are returned. But something is wrong… He can&#39;t be married—he&#39;s just bought a small cottage, big enough only for one, and he&#39;s on his own. Perhaps accepting Tom&#39;s invitation to escort her to the May Ball will be a turning point? It is—for Tom finally tells her the devastating truth. It seems they can&#39;t be together—and yet they simply can&#39;t be apart…&lt;/p&gt;
