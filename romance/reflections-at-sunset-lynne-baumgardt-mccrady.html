  <title>Reflections at Sunset - Lynne Baumgardt McCrady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The tornado outbreak in northern Alabama on April 27, 2011, messed up life for thousands of people in and around the little town of Guntersville. The devastation was so great that some of them never fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liveaboards and others just visiting their boats at fictional Sunset Marina on Lake Guntersville - those lucky enough to stay afloat - find themselves cut off from the outside world for several days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her house is destroyed, reclusive Jenna Schultz becomes a reluctant liveaboard on her deceased husbands boat. She keeps a Grief Journal in an attempt to come to terms with her loss. Jenna may be smart and beautiful, but she knows nothing about boats, and in this unusual environment, realizes that she also knows very little about herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-time loser in marriage, Aiden McCord, on the other hand, thinks he knows himself well enough to be frightened of what he feels for Jenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REFLECTIONS AT SUNSET is a love story. Everyone loves a good love story, especially if it includes water and boats.&lt;/p&gt;" />
