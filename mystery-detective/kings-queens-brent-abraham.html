      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the pinnacle of American crime stories. For many of todays inner-city youth, misguidance, a lack of vision, and not enough mind leads to time in prisonbut thats where things change for Earl. The young character meets perhaps the wisest mind in captivitya mind so supreme in wisdom that it was trapped there by a criminal underworld who feared it.
The gems of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding given to the young man is the breakdown guidance every young mind needs.
When God created man, He searched for a helpmate for him. He didnt bring Adam a Road-Dawg. He brought him a woman, Olds had taught. Thats your true partner in life.
She had been mistreated, socially discarded, and seemingly cursed with dark black skinuntil he came along. As he battles for his supremacy in the streets, the conversations shared between the two is the breath of life that shapes the intellects of Kings &amp; Queens." />
