From Johnny Weissmuller to Michael Phelps, the world&#39;s fastest swimmers share two common elements: high stroke rate and a high-elbow underwater pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many swimmers and triathletes neglect the underwater pull, distracted by stroke count or perfecting less critical details like body position, streamlining, and roll. &lt;i&gt;Swim Speed Secrets&lt;/i&gt; focuses on producing power-the most crucial element of swimming-to help triathletes and swimmers overhaul their swim stroke and find the speed that&#39;s been eluding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a commonsense approach that comes from decades of practice and years of hands-on coaching experience, Taormina shows swimmers how to transition to faster swimming. &lt;i&gt;Swim Speed Secrets&lt;/i&gt; includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best drills to cultivate a more sensitive feel for the water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dryland and strength building exercises to develop arm position and upper body musculature&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crisp photos of Olympic swimmers and variations in their high-elbow underwater pull&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear descriptions of the key moments of the underwater pull&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tips that helped her perform at a world-class level for two decades&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheila Taormina&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Swim Speed Secrets&lt;/i&gt; brings the focus back where it belongs-to a powerful underwater stroke.
