  <title>Red Rover, Red Rover - A. K. May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the first book in a fictional three part series titled &quot;Father of the Fatherless&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Rover is fictional but based on the true story of my own family&#39;s experience. According to a Pew Research Center study, one in 10 children in the U.S. now live with a grandparent. In an effort to keep children of troubled families from entering the foster care system, grandparents are urged to &quot;step up to the plate&quot; and become parents a second time around. (Sept 9 2010, Pew Research Center Social and Demographic Trends Report)&lt;/p&gt;
The commonality of the problem is such that the state of Nebraska was the last state to pass the law referred to as the Safe Haven law in July 2008. This law allows parents to leave their unwanted children at hospitals or police stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many mothers are appalled at their own like thoughts and can relate to and have compassion for my characters as the dilemma is not just news hype, it is real. The parents are desperate as they stand at that precipice considering murder of their own children, which so often happens, or the stigma of &quot;bad parent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray this story will reach someone who needs it. Buy your copy, and after reading it donate it to someone who might be at the precipice. Or buy two and donate one to a crisis center or shelter for underpriviledged people; someone who might not be able to afford toothpaste and soap, much less a book to read. The hope of joy despite circumstances is found in Jesus. This book will convey that truth to those who don&#39;t know hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
