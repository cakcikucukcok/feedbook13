  <title>I-C-E in Case of Emergency - Maureen Rooney Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unfortunately, the saying bad things happen to good people is played out every day in every American city, regardless of size. It is reported that over 36,700,000 calls are made annually to emergency call centers. The layout of my book, I-C-E In Case of Emergency: Your Essential Medical Journal, is intentional. It is meant to allow the use of the book to be as convenient and user-friendly as possible while at the same time providing the avenue every first responder needs to best ascertain and treat your medical emergency. The compact size allows the journal to fit in the glove compartment of a car, a womans purse or a childs backpack. You may also find this journal to be a useful tool for routine doctor appointments. I  C  E, In Case of Emergency is designed to meet the needs of a multi-generational family.
What an excellent resource! As a former emergency room nurse, having detailed medical history readily available can be a life saver.  A must have for everyone!
