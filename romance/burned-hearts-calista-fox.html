I couldn&#39;t get close enough to him, even though we were melded together, our bodies moving in perfect sync with each other. I wanted to be wrapped around his heart, live within his soul, consume his mind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;That was the selfish part of an obsessive, unrelenting love.

Every second thereafter proved they were either fated for love...or devastation. Ari DeMille Bax has been the target of the axed investors of Dane&#39;s exclusive resort, 10,000 Lux. They will stop at nothing to get their revenge--no matter &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; they have to take out in order to get to Dane. But as the final stand comes to a head, deception and betrayal threaten to rock the foundation of the life Ari and Dane have started to rebuild. Their intense love and desire for each other continues to burn deep, but the evil surrounding them could rip them apart for good. To save all that they cherish, Ari and Dane must lay their lives and their hearts on the line, once and for all...&lt;/p&gt;" />
