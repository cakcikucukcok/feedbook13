  <title>Blackstone Gate - Rev. Melissa A. Robitille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Brenna MacGregor likes her job at the Blackstone Museum in Edinburgh, Scotland. She likes her boss, Josiah Campbell, too - that is, until the old schemer shoves her through the Blackstone familys big secret; the Blackstone Gate! &lt;P&gt;	Tumbling through the Gate into 1760, Brenna lands in Lord Angus Blackstones bed, an alarming and distressing development for both of them. He finds this intrusive. He finds this annoying. He finds the Gate interfering in whether or not theres a woman in his life more than a little aggravating. Brenna, in turn, thinks that Angus is an incredibly hostile, insensitive, uncaring, sarcastic, and boorish fellow. Shes also just a little offended by the Blackstone familys expectation that because she came through the gate she must therefore be there to marry Angus, the current Earl. The fact that the Gate wont let her go back through to her own proper time doesnt make her very happy either. &lt;P&gt;	Determined as they are to dislike each other, they begin working together, looking through the Blackstone family records, searching for a way to get Brenna back home again. What they dont find is anything helpful. What they do find is a very mutual attraction. Troubles beset them on that front as well. &lt;P&gt;	Anguss first wife, now deceased, left him bitter, and wary of women. While Angus knows that Brenna didnt want to come through the Gate and upset his routine, or turn his lonely but safe world topsy-turvy, can he trust her with his two little daughters? Can he trust her with his own heart? &lt;P&gt;	Brennas childhood prepared her to refuse to trust herself or anyone else. Can she trust Angus to even be trustworthy? Can she trust herself to be a good wife to him? Can she trust herself to be a good mother to his daughters? &lt;P&gt;	If youve read Rev. Robitilles first novel In One Years Time, look here for answers, if you havent, the book stands alone beautifully.&lt;/P&gt;" />
