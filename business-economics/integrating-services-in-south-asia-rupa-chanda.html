  <title>Integrating Services in South Asia - Rupa Chanda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this era of globalization, every region and country in the world is pursuing some kind of integration to further its economic, geo-political, and strategic interests. This book explores the prospects for and challenges to services integration in South Asia through an in-depth analysis of services such as telecommunications, energy, tourism, health, and education. Identifying trends in performance, policy issues, and the status of intra-regional trade and investment initiatives, the book argues the case for services integration under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). It also stresses the need to address cross-cutting issues of regional mobility of service providers, taxes, transport, trade, research and development, and regulatory cooperation. Expanding the existing work on South Asian integration to cover services from an intra-regional perspective, this book is an important reference for future academic and policy work in South Asia. The industry, country, and regional level statistics provided by the book serve as a useful resource for taking stock of output, employment, trade, and investment in services in this region." />
