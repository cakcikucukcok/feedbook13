  <title>Oscar by My Side - Linda Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A high-spirited and lovable miniature Dachshund meets Rachel, the little fish girl, as they begin their rollercoaster adventures together adjusting to seaside living on the coast of Rhode Island. 
Who they meet along the way, and the relationships that follow will make you laugh out loud. Oscars nemesis, Lucinda, another tiny Dachshund who appears ever so sweet with her bejeweled collar and colorful bows, terrorizes the beachfront residents at every opportunity, including Oscar who just wants a playmate!
Read how Oscars love of getting into places where he shouldnt, sends him and Rachel on an emergency trip to the vets; and Rachel learns a very valuable lesson that she never forgets!
This poignant and entertaining book about a pint-size dog, Oscar, and Rachel, the girl studying the creatures of the sea, will make you chuckle and sometimes gasp but mostly delight you! It will touch your heart in a way only stories about the astonishing connection between humans and animals can. It might even help you discover a  better understanding of what it means to adopt a pet; or in this casehave a pet adopt you, as Oscar did with Rachel on that fateful day.
In the back of the book, you will find a synopsis of heartrending animal stories of courage and loyalty. A short questionnaire is also included that will help you decide if adoption is the right path for you." />
