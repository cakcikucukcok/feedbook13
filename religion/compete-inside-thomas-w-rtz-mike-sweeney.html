  <title>Compete Inside - Thomas W端rtz, Mike Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The opportunities that exist for Christian athletes are amazing. The potential to leave a lasting impact is overwhelming. The challenge is to stay focused on what ultimately matters: a vibrant relationship with God. Faith and sports are an invaluable tandem that sometimes fall off balance. Compete Inside offers athletes reflections, relevant Scripture passages, and piercing questions to help them develop their faith and integrate it into their athletic life. Nothing can be more valuable than investing in your faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; These reflections inspire the athlete to put first what should be first: our faith and trust in Christ. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Philip Rivers, 11 year NFL Veteran Quarterback, 5 time Pro Bowler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As athletes, we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. We put our performance out there for all the world to evaluate. We have high highs and low lows. Because of this, sports are more than physical competition or mental challenges. It becomes a spiritual journey. We all know the importance of focus in athletics. This book will help keep you focused on the most important thing, and assist you in leaving a meaningful legacy that lasts far beyond your playing days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Birk, 15 year NFL Veteran, Super Bowl Champion,  and 2011 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an excellent resource for all athletes striving to excel in their sport and live a life for Christ! It is highly relatable to the highs and low that athletes face and speaks the truth of Gods love and mercy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristen ONeill, Associate Head Womens Basketball Coach at Seattle University,  former WNBA, FIBA, and Division I athlete &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will serve as a road map to help us give God back the glorynot to strive to have him on our team, but to one day cross home plate with the winning run and be on his team. In society, sometimes we glorify athletes more than a man that died on a cross. It can create an EGO (Edging God Out). These great reflections help us bring God back into the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
