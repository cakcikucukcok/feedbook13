  <title>A Heart of a Warrior - Festus Mansaray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about my journey and struggle from Sierra Leone to England. My dreams of becoming a professional footballer faded away then in my mid-twenties when I found out about my heart condition. Due to the thickening of my heart muscles, I had to completely forget about becoming a professional footballer. I had to find another dream, so I became interested in business. With the help of my good friend and business partner, Mr Joseph Majik, who taught me all I needed to know about business both theoretically and practically, I went and tried to open my first business, which was a gym for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, I was not experienced enough, and I did not have all the necessary things needed. Also, according to my SWOT analysis, my weakness was that it was an outdoor training gym, and also I had to use the park to train my clients, so this business did not materialise. After a couple of months, Joseph and I combined our entrepreneurial knowledge to establish ACF Sports Management Limited Company." />
