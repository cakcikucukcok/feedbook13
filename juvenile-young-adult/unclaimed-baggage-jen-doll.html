Nell had to leave behind her best friends, perfect life, and too-good-to-be-true boyfriend in Chicago to move to Alabama. Grant was the star quarterback and epitome of &quot;Mr. Popular&quot; whose drinking problem has all but destroyed his life. What do these three have in common? A summer job working in a store called Unclaimed Baggage cataloging and selling other people&#39;s lost luggage. Together they find that through friendship, they can unpack some of their own emotional baggage and move on into the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
