  <title>Youth-Serving Libraries in Japan, Russia, and the United States - Lesley S. J. Farmer, Natalia Gendina, Yuriko Nakamura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, interest in International Librarianship has grown rapidly and will continue to grow as globalization influences education and librarianship. In countries around the world, public and school libraries have unique roles and their staffs collaborate across types of libraries to varying degrees. Library staff preparation, training, and ongoing learning and organization of youth-serving librarians mirror each country&amp;rsquo;s values and priorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The essays in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Youth-Serving Libraries in Japan, Russia, and the United States&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; address the universal and culture-specific aspects of library services to children and teens in these three countries. This collection shows how libraries have developed in light of each country&amp;rsquo;s political, educational, and social history. They examine how government and citizen roles in youth-serving libraries also reflect culturally defined social structures. The chapters highlight unique collections and services within each country and also show how librarians deal with the challenges they encounter, both from within their culture as well as from outside&amp;mdash;including natural disasters. Each country&amp;rsquo;s authors discuss contemporary issues that face youth-serving libraries, such as information literacy, reading in a multimedia world, and the overarching influence of technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book will be of interest to youth-serving librarians around the world, library educators, and for those studying international and young adult librarianship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
