  <title>Striving for Perfection - Gerald D. Curry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The success of todays military officers rests squarely on the shoulders of the men and women of the past. In Striving for Perfection, author Gerald D. Curry, a former US Airforce Colonel, reaches back through the annals of history to help todays professional military officers navigate a successful career. Curry shares rarely known insights on historical accomplishments from every major war in US history, from the Revolutionary War through the Global War on Terrorism. He pulls unique examples of success strategies, cultural understandings, and sage advice from African American servicemen and women who have worn the uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striving for Perfection goes beyond the typical leadership principles by offering significant experiences told from an African American perspectivefrom the only people deliberately brought to America for the sole purpose of servitude. Curry shows how black American patriots consistently looked beyond their current circumstances and served gallantly while seeking equality and social justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide describes the barriers that have existed within most African American communities, and it narrates how these neighborhoods continually birth great leaders. Although geared toward military professionals, Striving for Perfection can help all leaders in any profession who supervise and work with African Americans. Introducing proven success strategies, it provides a better understanding of diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
