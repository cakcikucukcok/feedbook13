  <title>SBC - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a corn-fed Midwestern white boy like Archie, rough and rugged black men stands as the masters of intrigue dominating his raunchiest fantasies. Secretly, he&amp;rsquo;s been pinning to be accosted by one, if not many, for a number of years to quench his longing thirst. So when an internet hookup finally looks promising late one night on a deserted train station platform, his night of lust takes him on a wild ride he won&amp;rsquo;t soon forget!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Goddamn! That&amp;rsquo;s enough to kill a man, Archie.&amp;rdquo; Cecil said after finally getting his thoughts together with the weight of a million-dollar come shot sitting on my face starting to feel cruddy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You look handsome,&amp;rdquo; Cecil puffed, chuckling without the feral twist in his face. I let him look at me drenched in his sweet baby batter a second longer before I took the bottom of my shirt and wiped it off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If I knew it was going to be all that I would&amp;rsquo;ve put in for some ass, too.&amp;rdquo; Cecil slipped back into his shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You couldn&amp;rsquo;t have handled it.&amp;rdquo; I boasted, struggling to get off my kneepads. The train made a sudden stop a station before mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, you maybe right about that!&amp;rdquo; Cecil caught me before I stumbled over. &amp;ldquo;But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;ve gone out happy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I chuckled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tell you what,&amp;rdquo; Cecil said fixing up his pants. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave the ball in your court if you think you&amp;rsquo;re ready for this again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh really,&amp;rdquo; I said watching him reach for a piece of paper and a pen above the switchboard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Usually I work second shift down at the plant. The time right before work ain&amp;rsquo;t good, but everything else afterwards is fair game for a night owl like me. Hit me up sometime&amp;hellip;even if it ain&amp;rsquo;t about scoring in that ass. Though, be warned, if you happen to spend the night at my place I&amp;rsquo;ll be jocking for the chance. I won&amp;rsquo;t pressure you or anything, of course, but just know that I&amp;rsquo;ll be trying really hard!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And what if I invite you over to my place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then it sound to me like you&amp;rsquo;d be laying the whole shebang out on the table!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Silence grew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll have to remember that.&amp;rdquo; I conceded the break the pause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cecil looked down at my shirt. Obviously, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see how much he came in the limited light we had but if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything as heavy and as grimy as it felt, it was like a translucent blood bath that my camouflage shirt couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t let you go home like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled off his wifebeater and handed it off to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I repeated. &amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be hardheaded. Put it on! I know it ain&amp;rsquo;t the cleanest thing in the world, but I can&amp;rsquo;t have you hopping in the cab reeking of me. Regardless of how good I am.&amp;rdquo; Cecil winked&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pulled off my shirt and discarded it on the floor, slipping on the navy blue wifebeater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Feels better, don&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; He thumbed a nipple through the ribbed fabric.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep,&amp;rdquo; I swallowed hard at the intimacy." />
