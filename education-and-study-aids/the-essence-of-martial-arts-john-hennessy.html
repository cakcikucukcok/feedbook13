  <title>The Essence of Martial Arts - John Hennessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this guide, author John Hennessy presents a concise, to-the-point volume on martial arts written from the perspective of prospective students to help make sense of complicated routines that remained reserved for senior martial
arts students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Essence of Martial Arts&lt;/i&gt; is an easy-to-read instructional guide to mastering the more difficult maneuvers and then applying them to real-world scenarios. You may be new to martial arts, experienced, or somewhere in between. Perhaps
youve never been to a dojo, dojang or kwoon, or perhaps you spend a large portion of your time at one of them. Whatever the case, you will be able to pick up the elements of martial arts quickly and put them to use. This guide covers the basics, but also addresses more specific approaches for fighting and
self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;
So jump right in. With good guidance, its not difficult to achieve excellence in martial arts if you absolutely commit to doing so.
Synopsis
Written from the unique perspective of an experienced martial arts instructor, the book is a concise collection of theories that the author knows to work in practise. Throughout, the book is easy to read, and balances a humorous style when telling real life stories which enhances the serious points the author wants to convey.
Therefore, the book is summarised into the basic, intermediate and advanced levels that all readers can pick up the elements quickly and put them to use. There are specific chapters on Kung Fu (Wing Chun), Tai Chi, Karate and Jeet Kune Do. This is a very personal book in which the author details how and why he got into martial arts, through to chapters on real practical life-saving methods, street fighting, self-defence for women, and how to succeed in tournaments. Anyone interested in martial arts will not fail to benefit from this book.
Why you should buy this book:-
Many chapters have insights that some teachers won&#39;t tell you. Often they will tell you what works for them, but not explain in detail what will work for you. So what is produced from some Schools, are people who have some individual strengths, but many weaknesses that the training, for whatever reason, does not correct.
This book helps you focus on what is important. It does not go on and on about difficult techniques that you cannot do without proper guidance. This book explains basic and more advanced approaches, simply and methodically.
It is a book any beginner can improve from, and many advanced martial artists can benefit from.
Chapters Include:
    Tai Chi - How to harmonise internal energy to turn it into external force
    Re-directing your Opponent&#39;s Energy - How to beat someone without throwing a single punch
    Kung Fu - How to blow your opponent away, effectively and with relative ease
    Jeet Kune Do - How to use this most unsettling of styles to devastating effect
    Karate -How to use discipline and focus to overcome your opponent
    Self Defence Principles for Women - Reasons why women can be confident against potential attackers
    Tournaments and Street Fighting for Real - Putting what you learn into a real context that tests how much you have learnt
And much more." />
