Osmond, a prolific writer and a matured believer in Christ inspired by the Holy Spirit has revealed in this book Jesus as a gift to humankind, His deity and attributes as Governor, Counselor, Mighty God as stated in Isaiah 9:6. He reminds believers that Jesus as a gift must be received and the recipient must grow in His knowledge and operate by His operational principles. It is at this point that the gift will be of full benefit to the recipient.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
