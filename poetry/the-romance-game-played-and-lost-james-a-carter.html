  <title>The Romance Game Played and Lost - James A. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Romance Game: Played And Lost is an adult-themed collection
of poems. In an age of social networks and relationship websites, love
can happen across vast distances. One never knows who one meets
and falls for. The Romance Game: Played And Lost deals with one
such relationship. In the beginning (Hiding Beauty and Trophy Girl)
the attraction is mutual, and the pursuit relentless (Flowers for the
Lady and Conquest In The Midwest). Next come the excitement and
euphoria of new love (Youre I My Head), followed by the excesses of
limitless gratification (O, Gena Porny, How I Know You).
Eventually, as the two individuals discovered the limits of their ability
to meet each others non-sexual needs (limited by his religiosity) things
begin to fall apart; and when the end becomes apparent (Love, In
Desperation) she decides to take what she could (Nightmare). All this
stated in rhyme, and with rhythm.
The Romance Game: Played And Lost is an entertaining yet moving
anthology of the pains and gains of romance. The collection of poems
fascinatingly captures the many emotions (from a male perspective)
of falling in and out of love. From the empathetic A Helping Hand, to
the harsh Nightmare, the collection covers the full range of emotions
possible in a tumultuous affair.   In an age of social networks and
relationship websites, love can
happen across vast distances.
One never knows who one meets
and falls for. The collection of
poems in The Romance Game:
Played And Lost tells the story
one such relationship. Beginning
with mutual attraction, the story
progresses thru the pursuit, to
the excitement and euphoria
of new love, to the excesses of
limitless gratification, only to
end in heart break. All this told in
rhyme, and with rhythm." />
