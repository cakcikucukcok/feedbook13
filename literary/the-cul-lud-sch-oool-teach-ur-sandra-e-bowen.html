  <title>The Cul-Lud Sch-Oool Teach-Ur - Sandra E. Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FICTION&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;b&gt;There was a time in the South when colored school 
teachers&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
were revered by everybody in the community, white and colored. Th ese
respected mentors were predominantly female and taught in elementary
schools where the bulk of southern school attendance was concentrated.
Traditionally these respected women were choice ladies sought after and
targeted by a coterie of colored men, many who had not completed the
elementary grades, and were low wage earners. Th eir thang was to marry
one of these women distinguished by their roll books. Most of these men
were decent, and some loved the women who would elevate them to
statures they would never attain otherwise. And there was Joe Cephus
Divine who rejected all women but school teachers and who justifi ed his
rejection: I didnt LOVE none of them--other women. A mans got to at
least LOVE a woman he doesnt want. &lt;capital&gt;I MARRIED WHO I WANTED.
A MAN DOESNT HAVE TO LOVE WHO HE WANTS. &lt;/capital&gt;After
two marriages and two divorces, Joe Cephus marries Johnnye Jamison,
who also has an agenda
remembering you are a walking cosmos.&lt;p&gt;" />
