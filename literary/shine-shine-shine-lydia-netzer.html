      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Over the moon with a metaphysical spin.  Heart-tugging...it is struggling to understand the physical realities of life and the nature of what makes us human....Nicely unpredictable...Extraordinary.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; --Janet Maslin, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Maxon met Sunny, he was seven years, four months, and eighteen-days old. Or, he was 2693 rotations of the earth old. Maxon was different. Sunny was different. They were different together.&lt;br&gt;Now, twenty years later, they are married, and Sunny wants, more than anything, to be &quot;normal.&quot; She&#39;s got the housewife thing down perfectly, but Maxon, a genius engineer, is on a NASA mission to the moon, programming robots for a new colony. Once they were two outcasts who found unlikely love in each other: a wondrous, strange relationship formed from urgent desire for connection. But now they&#39;re parents to an autistic son. And Sunny is pregnant again. And her mother is dying in the hospital. Their marriage is on the brink of imploding, and they&#39;re at each other&#39;s throats with blame and fear. What exactly has gone wrong?&lt;br&gt;Sunny wishes Maxon would turn the rocket around and come straight-the-hell home.&lt;br&gt;When an accident in space puts the mission in peril, everything Sunny and Maxon have built hangs in the balance. Dark secrets, long-forgotten murders, and a blond wig all come tumbling to the light. And nothing will ever be the same....&lt;br&gt;A debut of singular power and intelligence, &lt;i&gt;Shine Shine Shine&lt;/i&gt; is a unique love story, an adventure between worlds, and a stunning novel of love, death, and what it means to be human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shine Shine Shine&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;" />
