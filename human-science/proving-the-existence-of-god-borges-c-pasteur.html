  <title>Proving the Existence of God - Borges C. Pasteur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein this book is great works found within the highest power of thoughts shared from a young writer by the name of Borges C. Pasteur. In this book you will find so many things that point to the existences of God, through faith, facts, nature, scriptures, science history and thoughts that before was not heard of, until the making of this book came to be. The goal of these great texts is to give one the greater understandings of the world, space, time and the ordinance that God the Creator left for us to enjoy in the righteous manner and so much more, in which one can come to believe in the Creator of the heaven and the earth. Also you will find quotes from great people like Jesus Christ the LORD of lords, Albert Einstein, Sr. Isaac Newton, Noah who build the ark and what God shared with him, Dr. King, a wonderful person I know and so many more to broaden your mind, to find and to look beyond religion and see that God lives on. That the entire human race exists for this Greater purpose of God. But we must first live this life the here and now, before understanding beyond what we can see, that is eternity,  to one day have it in come our grips by being worthy of it. We must first love the little things and understand them. So we can know what we are here for and have to fulfill before we can understand the greater things of God that would blow our minds, if we were to see them and know them now. Just for what you are going to read in this book it will bring a great amount of understanding to your mind. Things like, the purpose for the sand of the sea, what causes the ocean tides to divided, the reason we see the rainbow in the sky today, what science cannot fully explain but only found within the Holy bible, the meaning of the word Bible, the things our founding Fathers new about our great country. You will know some of these insights just from reading what God allowed me to find and explain in this book, it will bring you more and greater understanding and broaden your thoughts to think highly on a normal bases. You will love what comes to mind, so enjoy what I now understand, in which many of the brilliant mind of the past understood." />
