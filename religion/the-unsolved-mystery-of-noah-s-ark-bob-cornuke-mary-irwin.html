  <title>The Unsolved Mystery of Noah’S Ark - Bob Cornuke, Mary Irwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ararat, a behemoth of a mountain, is 17,000 feet of pain for anyone who dares trespass upon its icy heights. It is a place of dread where one wrong step can send climbers careening down a steep, glacial field into the abyss known as the Ahora Gorge. Many have died on those slopes, and some have never been seen again. So why do climbers come to this place on the far east of the Turkish Frontier? It is not for sport alone; in fact, for most, that is far from the real reason. They come to Ararat flirting with death to find an old boat we all know as Noahs ark. It is said that its rotting corpse is somewhere up there in the swirling clouds and slumbering silence of ancient ice. Come with Mary Irwin, one of the original ark-aeologists, as she travels to Ararat and back again uncovering many of the ancient secrets of Noahs ark. You may be surprised what you find!" />
