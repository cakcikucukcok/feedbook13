Were it not for her faith in the Trinity and all her family, church parishioners, and friends prayers, she may not have survived a number of occasions. She believes that if you pray enough, have a strong faith, and ask God/Trinity to strengthen your faith, you will receive graces and blessings toward your desire for better health, study habits, or marriage, etc. God is merciful and loving and will answer your prayers. He may not always answer your prayers as you expect him to, but he does answer your prayers." />
