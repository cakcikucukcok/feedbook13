  <title>God’S Whisper - Maggie Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Light
Lord, as I kneel beside my bed
And I begin to pray
Your Spirit overwhelms me
As I search for words to say.
As I close my eyes and bow my head
I see a shining light
Coming closer towards me
Brightening up the night.
As I let the light surround me
I keep perfectly still
As silent tears fall, I say
Father, help me to do Your Will.
You pulled me out of the darkness
When all my hope was gone
You gently set me on my feet
As Your Hand I leant upon.
You showed me all the goodness Lord
That I had never known
And the seed You planted in me
At last, has finally grown.
Then a voice inside me spoke aloud
Open your eyes child and see.
The light around you will remain
And forever more will be.
I chose you a long, long time ago
But it had to be your choice
To break away from Satans power
Now at last we can rejoice.
The angels sang and also cried
When you first came to me.
They surrounded you with their love
As you accepted The Holy Trinity
Things will become hard at first
As Satan begins to fight
But keep at peace and dont forget
The brightness of this light.
Now its time for you to sleep
And with you Ill remain
Keep your faith and hang on to me
And Ill take away your pain.
Dont take away Your Light I said
As it began to dim
Do not be afraid, said the Lord
As Ive planted the Light within." />
