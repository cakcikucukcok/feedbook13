  <title>Hope for the Journey: Reflections of God&#39;s Faithfulness - Richard Parrish MDiv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even believers sometimes have doubts. Many followers have issues of faith at some point in their spiritual journeys. Some are content to ignore those questions, and eventually, their faith may wane. Even those who don&#39;t leave their churches do not have the spiritual lives they could have. Others, however, look to discover the reasons behind their doubts or other concerns and become stronger in their faith.   In Hope for the Journey: Reflections of God&#39;s Faithfulness, author Richard Parrish MDiv helps believers work through their faith issues. Sometimes that requires a major overhaul of who we believe God to be. Through this devotional, Parrish shows us how to adopt a different view of the Deity and become closer to God, to know God, and not just in the religious sense. Questions for reflection help you think deeply about and internalize what you&#39;ve read." />
