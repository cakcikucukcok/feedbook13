  <title>A Dreamer&#39;s Diary - Tim Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A Dreamers Diary, Dethroning the Underachiever&quot; is a compilation of poems that are designed to insight the mind, encourage the heart, inspire the will, and raise the spirit.  These four pillars are the foundation of what is known as motivational poetry.  This special kind of poetry invites readers to participate in the process of healing and growing by learning how to shape what they think and feel rather than just express it.  A reader can go from searching for significance to reaching for greatness by discovering his ability to overcome his obstacles, endure his struggles, and outlast his troubles.  This book addresses low self esteem, inaccurate identity, and misguided direction, as well as depression, oppression, and suppression and does so with an emphasis on the need to dream.  A Dreamers Diary is an excellent resource material for teachers, counselors, coaches, facilitators, students, or anyone seeking to elevate their thinking to match their true ability and is an excellent read for lovers of poetry or those who simply need encouragement." />
