  <title>Life and Adventures on Mission Trips - Dr. Spencer Meckstroth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Join an optometrist as he journeys throughout the world on short-term missionary trips, introducing people to God and sight.
Dr. Spencer Meckstroth went on his first medical mission trip to Belize in 1989, and hes been traveling to Third World countries ever since. In &lt;i&gt;Life and Adventures on Mission Trips,&lt;/i&gt; he shares stories from more than eighty trips to twenty-three countries. Ranging from exciting to sad to inspiring, these tales show what missionary work is all about.
Between trips, Dr. Meckstroth collects glasses to share with the needy. It takes time and effort to clean, sort, and label them, but the look on the faces of people who can see again makes it all worth it. He also hands out Bibles to people who are excited to move closer to God.
Life as a full-time optometrist and part-time missionary is enjoyable and funrarely dull. Discover what its like, learn how missionaries help others, and be inspired to make a difference yourself as you discover &lt;i&gt;Life and Adventures on Mission Trips. &lt;/i&gt;" />
