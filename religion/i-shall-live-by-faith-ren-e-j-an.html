  <title>I Shall Live by Faith - Renée Jéan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by Congress in 1776, declaring the independence of the United States of America, &quot;that all men are created equal [and] that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.&quot; As a nation, we celebrate this independence annually on July 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The Declaration of His-dependence was drafted by Rene Jan and adopted by the Lord Jesus Christ for worldwide distribution, declaring our dependence on the King of kings and Lord of lordsthat all are fearfully and wonderfully made in His image and that we are endowed by the Holy Ghost with specific, unassailable power! Thus, as the people of God, we celebrate our dependence on the mighty God, both now and forevermore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The definition of the noun &lt;em&gt;His-dependence&lt;/em&gt; is complete assurance, confidence, and faith in God. The nouns origin is from the Alpha and Omega, applicable in all languages and nations, for He is equivalent to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 1:17 confirms, &quot;For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, the just shall live by faith.&quot; &lt;em&gt;I Shall Live by Faith&lt;/em&gt; teaches us how to completely trust and depend on God, His promises, and His mandate over our lives. This book empowers readers to grow in their faith, decree and declare specific biblical entitlements, and accomplish what we speak by the authority of the Holy Ghostby faith! This Book helps readers put into practice the principles of Faith established in the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
