  <title>From Persecution to Service: the Chaplain Gary Cohen Story. - Gary Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Gary Cohen, a Jewish boy who was persecuted bitterly in school, and how he became a Christian. When his family was shocked at his conversion, Gary joined the army. He suffered through basic training, remained in the army reserves, and eventually became an officer and an army chaplain. After graduating from the USAF Air War College, he rose to the rank of colonel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a young man who gave away his clothes to needy missionaries and ended up with more suits than one can count. It is an account of a young man who rarely traveled outside of his home in Philadelphia and went to college only nine blocks from his house, to one who earned a commercial pilots license and traveled to teach and preach the gospel from Seoul, Korea and Hong Kong to Australia, Israel, and Egypt, and a hundred more places. This is an inspiring story of how the Lord can lift up someone on the ground and then use him to lift others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
