  <title>The Christmas Wedding Ring - Susan Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;New York Times bestselling author Susan Mallery returns with a classic story of destiny, desire and a little holiday magic!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In her youth, Molly Anderson couldn&#39;t help crushing on gorgeous bad boy Dylan Black–even though he only had eyes for her older sister. When things didn&#39;t work out between them, he said goodbye to Molly as well, vowing they&#39;d have a great adventure when she grew up. Years later, dumped by her fiancé just before Christmas, she&#39;s finally ready to take Dylan up on his promise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A guarded Dylan always had a weakness for Molly, and when she waltzes back into his life–grown-up and gorgeous–he&#39;s stunned. So why not whisk her away for some no-strings-attached fun?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Laughter-filled days and late-night kisses are changing Molly&#39;s life, for good. The only gift she truly wants now is Dylan&#39;s love, but when he discovers the secret she&#39;s been keeping, she may lose him again…this time forever.&lt;/p&gt;
