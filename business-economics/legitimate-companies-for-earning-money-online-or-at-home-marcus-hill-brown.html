      <meta name="description" content="I have researched hundreds of work at home opportunities.  All these opportunities are legitimate.  Furthermore, there are opportunities for even the most unqualified person. A few opportunities listed are for three-year-olds.  There are many opportunities for teenagers.  You can legitimately get paid for texting, chatting, helping people purchase tickets, helping people shop, adult texting or phone acting, selling hair or crafts, writing, etc.  I&#39;ve provided somewhere between 250 and 300 legitimate opportunities here that have been researched and proven to be valid.  Anyone can make some cash from home.  Did you know Amazon, GE, American Airlines and many other big names hire full time employees to work from home.  Don&#39;t pass over this book.  Once again these opportunities are legitimate.  It took me several months to discover and verify all these opportunities. I promise you this book is worth every dime!  Don&#39;t miss out, generate some side revenue!" />
