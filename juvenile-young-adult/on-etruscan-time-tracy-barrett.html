  <title>On Etruscan Time - Tracy Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A shadow moved in the doorway of the building. It was a boy. As he hesitated, someone must have pushes him from behind. He stumbled down the short stairway and fell heavily to his knees.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;He couldn&#39;t break his fall, Hector realized, because his arms were tied behind him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A mysterious talisman transports a boy back to ancient Italy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one ever listens to Hector. He wanted to hang out with his friends this summer, but instead he&#39;s stuck in Italy at an archaeological dig with his mom. The ancient Etruscan artifacts are interesting, but no one has time for him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he makes a discovery of his own-a strange, unsettling stone that looks like an eye. The stone brings nightmares about Arath, an Etruscan boy who died thousands of years ago but now begs for Hector&#39;s help. Are these just dreams, or is Arath really in danger? As Hector unearths the truth, he realizes that he can make himself heard when it counts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
