  <title>Being at Home in the Universe - Richard Bellingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="T. S. Elliot wrote: &lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh not fleshless; Neither from not towards; at the still point , there the dance is, Except for the point, the still point. There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;This book talks about the still point in an entirely new way by framing it as our internal home. It also provides a path to coming home based on extensive research and personal experience. If you are interested in the dance of spiritual transformation, this is a must read. Barry Cohen, Ph.D.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Dr. Bellingham enlightens the reader by sharing his personal life experiences in an extraordinarily meaningful context. He bridges the divide between eastern and western thought to form one fully human message. He has the rare ability to satisfy and integrate our intellectual curiosity with our search for spiritual fulfillment. Bill OBrien, Ph.D. &lt;/P 
&lt;P&gt;Having known the author for over 40 years, and witnessing many aspects of his spiritual journey, I highly recommend this book for anyone who continues to strive to find his inner self, or to be HOME. My own quest for SERENITY has been enriched by reading this book, and by witnessing Dr. Bellinghams life-long desire to find inner peace. We can indeed transform our lives from a mindless drill to a mindful dance with enough work, desire and by digesting the thoughts expressed in this wonderful accounting of the authors life and experiences. Ronald Irwin M.D. &lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;This is coming-to-wisdom story with hope for us all. This tale is all personal, with regular bits of carefully crafted ways to grasp the most elusive thoughts of the worlds greatest teachers and soul guides. Read it. Smile at the disarming honesty. And be heartened. For hes showing how wisdom can flourish more widely than ever in America. -Artie Egendorf, Ph. D. Author of Healing from the War and originator of Super Integral Synergy (http://sismoves.com)&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;By openly and honestly illuminating his experience and journey over 40 years, Dr. Bellingham shines a bright light on our own unique paths. He knows the territory with all its hills and valleys. With this book we, who are researchers, can be assured we are home already. To me, being fully present with a deep sense of love for all things is the key message. We are not separate. Mary Alice Fox&lt;/P&gt;" />
