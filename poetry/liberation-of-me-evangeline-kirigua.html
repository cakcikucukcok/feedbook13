  <title>Liberation of Me - Evangeline Kirigua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary                                                                
This riveting collection of poems by Evangeline Kirigua opens the window for the reader to experience the various situations which are woven into the delicate cloth of life. The poems touch on key issues such as families, life, love, deception and heartbreak.For instance,  the poem I Say, Not Now vividly describes the struggles of a working person, trying to hold out against the daily pressures of life.
 Other poems such as I said I do    address the issues of deception, domestic violence, and betrayal. Kirigua opens her heart to the reader in these poems. She   invites the reader to share in her passion of living life to its fullness.
Self identity is a matter that is very dear to the writer, having come up the rocky road to claim her own identity. This is the message she brings out in Defiant. She is conveying to the reader that it does not matter how anyone perceives them; it is more important for one to be comfortable with who they are, rather than wait for anyone elses validation. She is saying to the reader: Square up your shoulders and walk tall, there is only one person like you, and that is yourself." />
