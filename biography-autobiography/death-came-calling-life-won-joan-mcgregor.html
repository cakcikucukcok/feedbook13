  <title>Death Came Calling - Life Won - Joan McGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the way home from a vacation, JoAn kept hearing what she thought was a song running through her head. Eventually, she realized it was a message. She wrote it down on a scrap of paper and later typed it, wondering why that message, which was a poem, had come to her. Following an auto accident and her descent into an abyss of pain and critical illness, she realized the poem was a gift to encourage her on the most difficult journey of her life. That critical illness led to the study of the scriptures on healing and an intensive search for the healing ministry of Jesus. Her book takes the reader on that journey as she prayed and hoped for the healing Jesus offered in his earthly ministry. Her hope is to encourage and empower the seeker to trust in the God of creation on their own journey, for God has not left us defenseless but has equipped us for the journey no matter where that journey may lead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
