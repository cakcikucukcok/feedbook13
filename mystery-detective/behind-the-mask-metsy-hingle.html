Lily Webster and her son are in New Orleans, where she&amp;#39;s working as a waitress. One phone call and he can collect a cool million bucks&amp;#133;and forget the beautiful woman who seems to be hiding something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too late, he realizes he&amp;#39;s made a mistake&amp;#133;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only after he&amp;#39;s made the call does he begin to realize what he&amp;#39;s done. In the blink of an eye Michael Sullivan becomes Lily&amp;#39;s only chance for survival. Now all he has to do is convince her to trust him. But why would she put her life&amp;#151;and the life of her son&amp;#151;in the hands of the man who betrayed her?" />
