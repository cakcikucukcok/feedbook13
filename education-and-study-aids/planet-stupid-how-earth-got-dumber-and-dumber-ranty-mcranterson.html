      <meta name="description" content="America is approaching MEANING ZERO. Jean Baudrillard wrote, &quot;We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.&quot; When meaning vanishes, emotion fills the vacuum. Emotion is the only thing that means anything to most people these days. They slavishly worship their own feelings and experiences, and trash any notion of objective Truth. They proclaim their own truth. Everyone these days believes whatever they want to believe, regardless of any facts to the contrary. This is the post-facts world, the post-truth world. The only good news is fake news telling you exactly what you want to hear. All fake news with which you agree is true; all fake news with which you disagree is disgusting fake news! That&#39;s the way this game is played. Believe whatever serves your agenda, and dismiss anything that doesn&#39;t. This is Planet Stupid, and it&#39;s getting stupider with every passing second. Everything that could make it more intelligent is rejected and loathed. If that&#39;s not dumb, what is?" />
