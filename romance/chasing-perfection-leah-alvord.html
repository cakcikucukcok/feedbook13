  <title>Chasing Perfection - Leah Alvord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perfection. An unattainable goal for all of humanity. And yet, something the human race will always strive towards. Even if it means sacrificing the freedom of its perfect inhabitants.
Miranda Kirkpatrick was a beautiful genius with the perfect life. For eighteen years, she was just an average teenager with no great plans for the future. But when those eighteen years are up, she&#39;ll realize how much she was missing.
The Safety Facility is a place dedicated to preserving those who are just like Miranda: perfect.
After eighteen years on the outside, Miranda is sent back to the place where she was born in order to continue the Facility&#39;s mission to create more perfect beings.
Now, she must find a way to cope with having all of her decisions stolen from her and her very freedom stripped away.
With the help of new friends and her hot new mate, Caden, Miranda will soon learn that even perfection comes with a price." />
