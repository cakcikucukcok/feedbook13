  <title>Monster, 1959 - David Maine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Preservationist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Book of Samson,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Monster, 1959&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary tale of 1950s America---flawed, conflicted, and poised to enter the most culturally upended decade of the century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States government has been testing the long-term effects of high-level radiation on a few select islands in the South Pacific. Their efforts have produced killer plants, mole people, and a forty-foot creature named K. Covered in fur and feathers, gifted with unusable butterfly wings and the mental capacity of a goldfish, K. is an evolutionary experiment gone very awry. Although he has no real understanding of his world, he knows when he&#39;s hungry, and he knows to follow the drumbeats that lead him, every time, to the tree where a woman is offered to him as a sacrifice by the natives. When a group of American hunters stumble across the island, it&#39;s bound to get interesting, especially when the natives offer up the guide&#39;s beautiful wife to K. Not to be outdone, the Americans manage to capture him. Back in the States, they start a traveling show. The main attraction: K.&lt;/p&gt;" />
