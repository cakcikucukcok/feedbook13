      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Self-improvement can be deadly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Insurance agency programmer Dana Sanderson only wants peace and quiet at work. A desire her micromanaging boss somehow never respects.&lt;br /&gt;
Then the investigation of a rash of suspicious natural death claims lands on Dana&amp;rsquo;s laptop.&lt;br /&gt;
Failure means huge payouts for the company. Success means a huge bonus for her.&lt;br /&gt;
Find out if Dana&amp;rsquo;s risks outweigh her rewards in this clever digital mystery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An excerpt from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Sound of Murder&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you know about me,&amp;rdquo; Dana said, &amp;ldquo;you know why I can&amp;rsquo;t get back into hacking, Mr. Redmond. That part of my life is over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not asking you to get into their bank accounts. Just find the common thread. Take a look, a careful look, and see what you come up with. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about your usual projects for now. There&amp;rsquo;s a full year&amp;rsquo;s salary bonus for whoever works this out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A full&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Dana shook her head, quite certain she&amp;rsquo;d misunderstood. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re offering me a year&amp;rsquo;s pay? How could it be worth that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do the math. That much money would pay off her college debts and everything else she&amp;rsquo;d racked up putting her past firmly behind her. The prospect of returning to her hacker life, even temporarily, felt slightly less dreadful now.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;These were all in our lowest risk pool,&amp;rdquo; he said, raising his eyebrows. &amp;ldquo;Several of them had policies worth ten times your salary. Trust me. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it." />
