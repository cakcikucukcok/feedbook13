  <title>Decaying of America - Terry Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While racial tensions have increased in America during the first part of the twenty-first century, much of this distress has been exacerbated by liberal politicians. Black Americans have suffered injustices at the hands of the white ruling majority, especially during segregation, and these past injustices have influenced racial unrest today. Yet it is politicians who have created discriminatory attitudes in order to further their own political gains and positions of power.
In Decaying of America: Complacency, Indifference, Liberalism, and Ignorance, author and former police officer Terry Carter exposes the actions and inactions of an inept, apathetic, and corrupt government, and he explains how politicians influence the behaviors that result in the decay of society. Decaying of America explores contemporary events in the news and how politicians have used these stories to escalate moral decline, and Carter shares his experiences in law enforcement to show how police attitudes and behaviors have changed over the years during two drastically different periods of American history. 
So much of what we see in the news and in society is politically motivated or carried out due to indifference or ignorance. Understanding political motivations and learning about the experiences of law enforcement can help true Americans prevent a decline in values and morality." />
