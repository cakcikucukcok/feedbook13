  <title>On the Edge - E.D. Arrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Secrets lurked amongst the intimate group of family and friends  secrets they hoped and prayed would never be revealed. But when Jackson Pryce is murdered in the wee hours on that frosty Christmas morning, the secret he kept about his investigation of the underground world emerges. Then Jacksons handwritten notes fall into the hands of Detective Clay Stephens, his friend and former partner. Determined to find Jacksons murderer  no matter where or to whom the road leads  one by one, Clay shines a light on all of their secrets. Yet, only one secret would bring all of their fragile worlds crumbling down. Only one secret would wreak havoc on all of their lives. Only one secret would keep them all living on the edge. In time, only one secret would break through for all to see. It was destined to happenthe only question is  when, where, and how?
Would it be Bridgettes decision to keep secret the large sums of money she quietly withdrew from her personal bank account, or that she sneaked off the Estate to spend a day of adventure with the one friend her husband desperately tried to keep away from his pregnant wife? Would it be Davids and Agnes decision to keep the question of their daughters paternity a secret, or that the man Bridgette knew as Uncle Jack and loved like a father shared much more with her mother than just a close friendship? Would it be Jeremys decision to keep hidden the sordid secret of his mother, Diana Robinson (alias Sara White) by claiming his parents were dead, or his night of lust and passion with his ex-lover, Fran McKenzie? Would it be Megans decision to keep hush-hush the shameful secret that she squandered away hundreds of thousands of dollars from her trust funds in the casinos, or waiting too late to disclose her relationship with another man  Reginald Douglas?" />
