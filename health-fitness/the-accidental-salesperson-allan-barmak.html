      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Almost every situation you face in life is a sales situation. You started at a young age when you tried to negotiate with your parents for a later bedtime, and you are still selling today, whether intentionally or by accident. Did you ever trade baseball cards when you were a kid? That&#39;s sales. Did you ever negotiate with your friends as to which clothes Barbie got to wear? That&#39;s sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Accidental Salesperson&lt;/I&gt; not only teaches you how to identify sales interactions, but also walks you through the steps of the sales process to help you achieve success in the long run, regardless of whether you are an &quot;accidental&quot; or a professional salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

Identify your potential sales target
Engage in dialogue to learn more about your prospect
Negotiate
Close the deal
&lt;p&gt;By following these simple steps, you can find the inner salesperson you never knew existed and lift your career to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
