  <title>The Man Who Killed His Brother - Stephen R. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wounded hero must confront his own worst enemy: himself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mick &quot;Brew&quot; Axbrewder was once a great P.I. That was before he accidentally shot and killed a  cop--worse, a cop who happened to be his own brother. Now he only works off and on, as muscle for his old partner, Ginny Fistoulari. It&#39;s a living. And it provides an occasional opportunity for him to dry out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their latest case demands more than muscle. Brew&#39;s dead brother&#39;s daughter has disappeared. His brother&#39;s widow wants him and Ginny to investigate. And both of them seem to expect him to sober up. Because the darkness they&#39;re finding under the surface of Sunbelt city Puerto del Sol goes beyond one missing teenager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axbrewder will need all his talents to confront that darkness. Most of all, he&#39;ll need to confront his own worst enemy--himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, bestselling author Stephen R. Donaldson published three novels about Mick Axbrewder and Ginny Fistoulari as paperback originals under the pseudonym Reed Stephens. Under his own name, Donaldson published a new novel in the sequence, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Fought Alone&lt;/i&gt;. Now, for Donaldson&#39;s millions of readers worldwide, the first of the original books, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Killed His Brother&lt;/i&gt;, appears under Donaldson&#39;s own name, in revised and expanded form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
