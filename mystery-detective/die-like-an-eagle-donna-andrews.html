  <title>Die Like an Eagle - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The brilliantly funny Donna Andrews delivers another winner in the acclaimed avian-themed series that mystery readers have come to love. The nineteenth book in her New York Times best-selling series continues to surprise and delight in this next knee-slapping adventure featuring Meg Langslow and all the eccentric characters that make up her world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg is Team Mom and Michael is coach of their twin sons&#39; youth baseball team, the Caerphilly Eagles. Meg tangles with Biff Brown, the petty, vindictive league head. On opening day, Biff&#39;s lookalike brother is found dead in the porta-potty at the ball field. So many people think Biff&#39;s scum that it would be easy to blame him, but he has an alibi--and Meg suspects he may actually have been the intended victim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Die Like an Eagle, readers can look forward to another zany Meg Langslow mystery--this one filled with the spirit of America&#39;s pastime and Donna&#39;s eagle eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Meg Langslow, the blacksmith heroine of her series, Donna Andrews was born and raised in Yorktown, Virginia. She introduced Meg to readers in her Malice Domestic Contest-winning first mystery, Murder with Peacocks, and readers are still laughing. This novel swept up the Agatha, Anthony, Barry, and a Romantic Times award for best first novel, and a Lefty for funniest mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
