  <title>Multan Forever - R.G. Beauchain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Multan Forever  a suspense fiction story that unfolds from two highly charged actual events that took place in the sixties that most people were not aware of, and for those that were, they still remain an open sore. Brantley, a Sigint specialist aboard a U.S. Intelligence frigate eavesdropping on the early days of the Six Day War is traumatized when the ship he is on is attacked by Israeli fighter planes and gunboats killing 34 of his buddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turns his back on the service and obtains an entry level manager position in a private firm producing weapon grade materials for the U.S. Navy only to discover the company is secretly transferring shipments of these materials to another country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brantley seizes the moment and sets in motion a plan that will lay dormant for almost forty years  at which time another world event will compel him to go forward with his plan. This is a fast moving and compelling suspense story that will keep the reader gripped in what can only be described as unimaginable events that lead to the threshold of catastrophic consequences that are not beyond the realm of credible possibilities in todays world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
