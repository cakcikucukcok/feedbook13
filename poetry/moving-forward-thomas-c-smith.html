  <title>Moving Forward - Thomas C. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of poems I have written throughout my life.
I started writing when I was in high school. The early poems were for girls that I knew. No copies of these were kept. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I started to retain copies in college. My poems moved from just words to life stories, personal thoughts and my God. I have shared some with a few friends, which for me is difficult, because I tend to keep most everyone at arms length. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My journey has been filled with lifes up and downs and my poems reflect the joys and sorrows I experienced and some you may have experienced. Most important for me is that Jesus is my constant companion who rejoices with me in the good times and carries me through the hard times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Psalm 23:  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. &lt;br&gt;
 NIV              He makes me to lie down in green pastures,&lt;br&gt;
                  he leads me beside quiet waters,&lt;br&gt;
                      he restores my soul.&lt;br&gt;
                  He guides me in paths of righteousness  &lt;br&gt;
                      for his names sake. &lt;br&gt;
                  Even though I walk &lt;br&gt;
                      through the valley of the shadow of death, &lt;br&gt;
                   I will fear no evil, for you are with me,&lt;br&gt;
                   your rod and your staff,&lt;br&gt;
                       they comfort me.&lt;br&gt;
                   You prepare a table before me&lt;br&gt;
                       in the presence of my enemies.&lt;br&gt;
                   You anoint my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
                       my cup overflows.&lt;br&gt;
                   Surely goodness and love will follow me&lt;br&gt;
                       all the days of my life,&lt;br&gt;
                    and I will dwell in the house of the Lord &lt;br&gt;
                       forever." />
