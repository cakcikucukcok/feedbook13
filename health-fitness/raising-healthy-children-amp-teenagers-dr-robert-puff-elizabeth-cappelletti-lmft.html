  <title>Raising Healthy Children &amp;amp; Teenagers - Dr. Robert Puff, Elizabeth Cappelletti LMFT</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raising Healthy Children and Teenagers is one of the most important things that we will ever do in life. How they turn out, how life goes for them, whether they experience joy and happiness because of their inner strength and resources, or struggle with life because of inadequate coping skills is largely in our hands. In this book we discuss three main areas that are crucial to raising healthy children: how you treat your children, what you expose your children to, and what you model for them. These three areas directly affect the overall well-being, behavior, and mental health of your children as well as pave the way for their future relationships. Learn how to build a healthy relationship with your children and how to limit their exposure to negative influences. Learn how your everyday actions impact your children and how to create change that will help you raise happy and healthy children and teens." />
