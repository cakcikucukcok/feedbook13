  <title>Astounding Prayer - Martin O. Opany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prayer is a fascinating subject; I assume that you have heard it taught in the church or somewhere else. More so, I assume that at one point in your life, you had a chance whereby you prayed, read or recited a prayer. Undeniably, prayer is a norm in the lives of most Christian believers and a common practice among other faiths in the world. People, who engage in prayers, pray for different reasons and in most cases, for divine intervention.
As a matter of fact, when we read through the pages of the Bible from the book of Genesis to Revelation; there are records of many prayers prayed by different people for different reasons. Captivatingly, reading through these
prayers, one cannot fail to ascertain that they were more than recitation of some well-known, ear catching phrases.
In reality, most of these prayers came from the outpouring of the hearts of men and women who sought divine intervention. Consequently, some of these prayers carry with them a whole load of meaning which sometimes we do not perceive. Presumably so, because when we read through, we do not take any solemn interest in them; after all, they are just prayers. This book looks at Paul who is one among many, who prayed some astounding prayers which are recorded in the Holy Scriptures. Even so, it focuses on the prayer he prayed to God for the church in Ephesus. Accordingly, it deals with his prayer as recorded in Ephesians 3:14-21.
Certainly, when you conduct a keen read through this prayer, you cannot fail to marvel at some of Pauls stunning statements. Consequently, this book dwells on and analyzes some of the statements in this prayer, bringing to our understanding the most startling truth of the union Christians have with the triune God and what that entails. More so, it brings to our thoughts the importance of praying in accordance to the written word of God." />
