      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Jesse Ward is back in the newest novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling This Man series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;The raw emotion and vulnerability is breathtaking.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  &quot;Super steamy, emotionally intense&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Life is good for Jesse &quot;The Lord&quot; Ward. Perfect, actually. He still has the charm, he&#39;s in great shape, and he still reduces his wife, Ava, to a pool of desire with a mere look. He&#39;s in full control, just how he likes it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But Jesse&#39;s perfect world falls apart when a terrible accident lands Ava in the hospital with a life-threatening head injury. Devastated and angry, he feels like his entire existence hangs in the balance. He cannot survive without this woman&#39;s love. So when she finally comes around, his shaking world begins to level out. But his nightmare doesn&#39;t end there. It&#39;s only just begun. Because his wife can&#39;t remember the last sixteen years of her life. That&#39;s all of him. All of their time together. He is a stranger to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now Jesse must do whatever it takes to find her memories . . . and help her fall madly, passionately in love with him all over again.&lt;br&gt;" />
