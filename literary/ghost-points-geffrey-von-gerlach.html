  <title>Ghost Points - Geffrey von Gerlach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acupuncture is a metaphor for life-- you find the point that is the most painful and
 drive a needle into it, piercing it with finely-honed consciousness.&lt;P&gt;
Randolph Mayer is a failed man in his own eyes.  He had been an accomplished 
photographer and internationally known, yet at  age seventy, he finds he has outlived his celebrity, his friends and worst of all his investments.  For him, suicide is a reasonable solution.  A young medical student inadvertently intervenes, robbing the old man of his graceful escape, and, as an act of contrition, decides to employ the legendary 13 GHOST POINTS of the ancient art of acupuncture to try and revive him.&lt;P&gt;
As each of the thirteen needles penetrates the old man&#39;s flesh, a memory held in that region of the body springs in vivid detail into Randolph&#39;s unconscious mind, allowing him to once again experience  the passions in his past.&lt;P&gt;
GHOST POINTS is an end of life crisis, a story of how one man is allowed to retrieve the moments of his life that have been obscured by the passage of time and buried under the weight of disappointment, to understand, to know and to finally believe that he had not failed, but rather had the experience of a truly remarkable life.&lt;P&gt;
The ancient Chinese believed that the demons of memory are held in
 the body  and can be retrieved by means of acupuncture.
 Kyle Randall believes it&#39;s worth a try to revive the old man whose
 suicide  attempt he cut short." />
