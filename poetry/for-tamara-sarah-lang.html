  <title>For Tamara - Sarah Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arranged as a mother&amp;#8217;s survival guide to her daughter, &lt;em&gt;For Tamara&lt;/em&gt; is a touching and inventive long poem about surviving and thriving from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Work of Days&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems simple: a long letter, from a mother to a daughter, relaying the information needed to survive on this earth. But as Sarah Lang&amp;#8217;s second book, &lt;em&gt;For Tamara&lt;/em&gt;, unfolds, it becomes a roughly-hewn, genre-bending, post-apocalyptic survival guide. The world with which we are familiar has ended, and in its wake are the countless dead and survivors who are little more than scavengers. The poem&amp;#8217;s unforgettable narrator, mother to a young girl named Tamara, has decided to leave her daughter with a document that will not only express her love for her, but that will also teach her how to live. The result is a hauntingly complex artifact and monologue, heartbreakingly consistent yet wildly unexpected, a story of survival and hope that, through the force of its profound form, brings its ideas, insights, and characters blindingly to life. Against this bleak setting, we fear for Tamara&#39;s future as we ponder our own. What results is a work of unflinching tenacity and tenderness. This is a poem of abiding power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
