  <title>Cry from the Deep: The Sinking of the Kursk, the Submarine Disaster That Riveted the World and Put the New Russia to the Ultimate Test - Ramsey Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A gripping account of the disastrous Russian submarine explosion that killed the entire crew, devastated the Russian people, and defined Vladimir Putin&#39;s post&amp;#8211;Cold War regime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What were Russian officials thinking when they waited 48 hours to acknowledge their most prized submarine was in trouble? Why did they track the desperate tappings of an unknown number of trapped sailors without sending an international SOS? Why did they repeatedly decline international rescue offers while their own rescue equipment repeatedly failed to make any progress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To a world community still mystified by deadly Russian deceits surrounding the Kursk submarine disaster, Ramsey Flynn&#39;s book uncovers the truth once and for all. Cry from the Deep has quickly become the definitive account of this pivotal moment in modern Russian history, as an angry Russian people &amp;#8211; aided and abetted by a fledging independent media &amp;#8211; openly clashed with Vladimir Putin and his new government&#39;s Soviet&amp;#8211;era tactics of secrecy and deception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flynn&#39;s searing narrative also documents how western officials, in a practiced silence reminiscent of the Cold War era failed to notify their post&amp;#8211;Soviet counterparts of the disaster, despite learning of the explosion hours before the Russians did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
