      <meta name="description" content="Grip Yodel is a man short in stature but tall in spirit and compassion for others. As a private detective, he has dedicated his life to solving riddles for others. He&#39;s just been hired by a strange new client, the most beautiful creature he&#39;s ever seen-a mermaid named Isurus. The problem is, the mermaid&#39;s external beauty hides her ugly intent. Isurus-the most powerful witch of her species-is furious that someone has dared to interfere with her plans. At the instigation of King Carcharodon of the Merfolk, she has created a spell  designed to massacre dolphins, which is  bound within the form of a perfect gem, the Terrible Pearl. Someone has stolen it from her. Even though Isurus doesn&#39;t tell Grip the truth about the pearl&#39;s true power and purpose, he has a bad feeling about this client.  Despite his misgivings, Grip takes the case. With his good friends Pebbles the horse and Alastair the leopard, he sets off to recover the pearl." />
