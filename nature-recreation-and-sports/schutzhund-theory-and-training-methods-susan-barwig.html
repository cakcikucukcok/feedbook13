  <title>Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods - Susan Barwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Schutzhund is one of the fastest-growing forms of canine competition in the United States. The desire to have a reliable protector and steady family companion all in the same dog has encouraged interest in the Schutzhund philosophy. Schutzhund began in nineteenth-century Europe as a test of a dog&#39;s ability to work for humans. In the early 1900s. Max von Stephanitz refined and redesigned the tests to include obedience, protection and tracking. Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods, a superb explanation of Schutzhund and its components, shows how obedience, protection and tracking all play an integral part in training a Schutzhund dog.&lt;P&gt;Authors Barwig and Hilliard emphasize selection and raising of the dog to suit the owner&#39;s needs as well as crystallizing the goals and techniques in training for each phase of the process. A unique format guides the reader first through an overview of each component and then into the philosophy and training techniques for all activities.&lt;P&gt;Beautifully organized and abundantly illustrated, this book will allow the reader to tailor these training systems to suit individual needs, producing a dog of value to many. Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods is a volume essential to any obedience or Schutzhund fan&#39;s library." />
