  <title>Beveled Edges and Mitered Corners - Mary Elizabeth Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words have dried up,&lt;br&gt;
brittle as pine straw, scorched by summer sun,&lt;br&gt;
fragile as fleeting ashes of burning leaves.&lt;br&gt;
They bud, but this drought leaves them&lt;br&gt;
hanging on vines like dried string beans.&lt;br&gt;
They rattle in the wind, empty and noisy,&lt;br&gt;
dry and hard from lack of inspiration,&lt;br&gt;
dried seeds in summer gourds of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mary Elizabeth Lee relies on her experiences traveling country roads in North and South Louisiana and teaching students for many years to influence her first collection of poetry that reflects on people, nature, and the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a Sunday drive where pines whisper to the blue horizon to a majestic oak that has seen its time to a light rain that falls around Catfish Town, Lee shares a variety of relatable poems that shine a light on the wildlife and landscape she observed during her travels and also from her perch on her back porch. With a strong, distinctive voice, Lee also ponders life, death, and everything in between while exploring the power of love, friendship, heartbreak, and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beveled Edges and Mitered Corners&lt;/i&gt; is an insightful collection of poetry that mirrors one womans walk through life as she encourages others to embrace all that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
