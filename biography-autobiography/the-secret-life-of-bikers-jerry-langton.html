  <title>The Secret Life of Bikers - Jerry Langton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Hard Way Out&lt;/em&gt; and for fans of &lt;em&gt;Sons of Anarchy&lt;/em&gt; comes a new book that reveals the cold, dark and dirty secrets of the biker underworld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hells Angels. Bandidos. Outlaws. Vagos. What would you do if a biker sat beside you in a bar? What about if a group of leather-and-denim-clad tough guys established a clubhouse in your neighbourhood? Television and movies glamourize bikers as freedom fighters, men who do things their own way, brothers in arms who party all the time and ride Harleys to escape everyday life, while news reports paint them as criminals, responsible for drug trafficking, brutal assaults and murder. That paradox, each side true in its own way, is what makes outlaw motorcycle gangs so very fascinating. What really goes on behind those heavily secured steel clubhouse doors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Secret Life of Bikers&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling crime author Jerry Langton tells the stories of the men who live the biker life as they have never been told before. Langton has interviewed many bikers over the past decade and shares their stories in these pages, often in their own words. He has also interviewed members of law enforcement to hear the biker story from the other side of the ledger. All told, this book offers highly unique and often bloody insights into the everyday workings of motorcycle clubs: the club hierarchy, the clubhouse, the parties, the initiation rituals, the brawls, the bodies and the brotherhood of blood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
