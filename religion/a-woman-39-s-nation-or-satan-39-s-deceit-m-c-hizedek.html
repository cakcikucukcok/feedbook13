      <meta name="description" content="1865  ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSASSINATED WOMENS FEMINIST MEMBER MARY SURRAT   HANGED FOR PARTICIPATIONLEADER OF GROUP FOUND HIDING IN VATICAN PAPAL GUARD
Before  his death Abraham Lincoln made the following statements to his trusted staff:
It is not against the Americans of the South alone that I am fighting, it is even more against
THE POPE OF ROME and his perfidious Jesuits and their blind and blood thirsty slaves that we    have to  defend ourselves  The Jesuits, have not yet killed me. But they would have surely
done it when I passed through  their most devoted city, Baltimore, had I not defeated their plans
by passing incognito a   few hours before they expected me. We have the proof that the company which has been  selected and organized to murder me was led by a rabid Roman Catholic, called Byrne; it was almost entirely composed of Roman Catholics; more than that, there were two disguised priests among them, to lead and encourage them.                                                                                                                                               ..Abraham Lincoln
  And indeed the American Womens Feminist Movement were now linked and involved  with the assassination of a sitting President of the United States and with a member of the American Womens Feminist Movement confirmed as guilty and hanged for the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. And then, so began the atrocities of the deaths of any elected president that was not a Socialist Democratic and those atrocities and Presidential genocide lasted from 1841 until the final assassination of President Warren Harding in 1923." />
