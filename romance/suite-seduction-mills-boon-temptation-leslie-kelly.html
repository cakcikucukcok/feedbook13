      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ruthie Sinclair is having one of those days. First she discovers she has to wear the bridesmaid&#39;s dress from hell to her cousin&#39;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then her lackluster boyfriend runs for the hills when she suggests they get a little &quot;closer.&quot; Is it any wonder she&#39;s having erotic dreams about a sexy stranger? Only, in the morning that stranger is still in her bed….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Robert Kendall has never slept better in his life–not that he slept much! Free-spirited, sexy Ruthie is the perfect woman for him and he wants to get to know her a lot better. Only, Ruthie&#39;s convinced that the best sex of Robert&#39;s life was a mistake. So what else can he do but keep her in his bed until he gets it right?&lt;/p&gt;
