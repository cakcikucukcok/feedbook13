  <title>Sometimes I Would Like to Sit Down and Cry - Amarilis Presilla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its no wonder that Amarilis Presilla has titled her memoir Sometimes I Would Like to Sit Down and Cry. Reminiscing can be painful when she thinks back on all the hardships she has knownnot just within her family but for the Cuban people as well. Since arriving in the United States from Cuba seven years ago, Amarilis has written it all down, reliving both the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her idyllic childhood in the riverside village of Mayari was not to last. A powerful flood laid waste to her beloved town, yet this was nothing compared to the coming upheaval of Castros revolution. What follows is an epic tale of love, family, struggle, self-improvement, and rebellion. Finally escaping and reuniting with her family, Amarilis Presilla now shares her triumphant story with you.&lt;/p&gt;
