  <title>The Great Illusion - Herbert Asbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;An absorbing and at times ironical humorous picture of the battle of Prohibition. Recommended.&quot; &amp;#8212; &lt;I&gt;Library Journal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;With the passing of the Volstead Act, the United States embraced Prohibition as the law of the land. From 1920 to 1933, the well-intentioned ban of the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors gave rise to a flourishing culture of bootleggers, gangsters, and corrupt officials. This witty and perceptive history by Herbert Asbury, the bestselling author of &lt;I&gt;The Gangs of New York&lt;/I&gt;, offers a wide-ranging survey of the Prohibition era that covers not only twentieth-century events but also the movement&#39;s inception in colonial times and its transformation into a religious crusade.&lt;BR&gt;A considerable portion of Americans viewed the end of liquor trafficking as an act of obedience to God&#39;s will and anticipated a new era of peace and prosperity. Instead, a vast criminal network of black market profiteers took root, promoting a spirit of lawlessness throughout the country. &lt;I&gt;The Great Illusion&lt;/I&gt; charts all aspects of the period&#39;s moral decline, from the activities of rumrunners who supplied speakeasies to those of crooked politicians and police who profited from the failed experiment of Prohibition." />
