  <title>Unconditionally - Erin Lyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a world where marriage doesn&#39;t exist--only seven-year contracts--you don&#39;t marry, you sign. You don&#39;t divorce, you breach. And sometimes, you just expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this hilarious conclusion to Erin Lyon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;I Love You Subject to the Following Terms and Conditions&lt;/i&gt;, Kate has accepted a job practicing signing law, the one type of law she swore she&#39;d never do - especially since what she thought was her very own happily ever after turned into just another expired contract. But between Kate&#39;s embarrassing penchant for running into exes in court, clients determined to use her as their very own therapist, and a couple having a knock-down, drag-out over the custody of the family guinea pig, at least the job&#39;s never boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Kate finally has a handle on her career, her love life is still, well, complicated. The former love of her life, Jonathan, wants her back. Her current main squeeze, Dave, wants to take things to the next level, but she still can&#39;t shake her wolf-in-sheep&#39;s-clothing vibe about him. And then there&#39;s Adam, her mad crush who really wants to be her friend. So, to sum up, one questionable ex, one player with a capital &quot;P,&quot; and one guy who&#39;s kind of stolen her heart even though she&#39;s in the friend zone. This should be a piece of cake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unconditionally&lt;/i&gt; is both a sweet and sexy romantic comedy and a hilariously relatable look at finding happiness where you least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
