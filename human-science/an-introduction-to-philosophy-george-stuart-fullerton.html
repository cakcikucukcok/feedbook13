  <title>An Introduction to Philosophy - George Stuart Fullerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Introduction to Philosophy explains the coming into being of fire, wind, clouds, water, and earth, as due to a condensation and expansion of the universal principle, air. The boldness of their speculations we may explain as due to a courage born of ignorance, but the explanations they offer are scientific in spirit, at least.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George Stuart Fullerton (1859&amp;ndash;1925) was an American philosopher and psychologist. Fullerton was born at Fatehgarh, India, the son of the Rev. Robert Stuart Fullerton. He came to this country as a youth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He graduated in 1879 from the University of Pennsylvania and in 1884 from Yale Divinity School; and returned to Pennsylvania to be an instructor, adjunct professor, and dean of the department of philosophy, dean of the college, and vice provost of the university. In 1904 he was appointed professor of philosophy at Columbia University, and served as head of the department.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was the host of the first annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in 1892 at the University of Pennsylvania, and the APA&amp;#39;s fifth president, in 1896." />
