  <title>Amoremiobello - Betta Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When her two traveling companions cancel their plans to visit India, Sofia Nejinskaya, a Russian American designer in her forties, still makes the trip from her home in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Sofia meets the handsome Italian Alessandro Salvuccian opportunistic Italian journalist and successful businessman with a time-tested set of tools for seductionat the resorts yoga class, he seems in tune with her perfect match list for the ideal man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their differing geographical locations, they begin a committed relationship, exchanging numerous e-mails and text messages and visiting one another regularly. But Alessandros roving Italian eyes, thoughtlessness, and insecurities threaten their love. The relationship is also rocked by their spiritual differences: she is Christian, and he belongs to the Cult of White Brotherhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, surprised by all the mystical coincidences that show they have much in common, Sofia believes in their love and life together, hoping to overcome Alessandros spiritual delusions and fallacies about relationships with women. But their marriage is not yet the happily ever after ending she imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;www.amoremiobello.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betta Stone demonstrates in her book Amoremiobello that when it comes to loveand fictionactions speak louder than beautiful Italian words. Amoremiobello, a password to the e-mail, means my amazing love, and Stone stays true to Alessandros character, incorporating Italian into the story and including Italian-to-English translations as footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueink Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel is a suggestion of the karmic wheel on which vital questions of trust and fidelity revolve.&lt;/p&gt;
