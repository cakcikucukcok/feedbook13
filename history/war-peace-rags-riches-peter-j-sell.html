  <title>War Peace Rags &amp; Riches - Peter J Sell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel is based on stories that I was told throughout my life from friends and relatives about our families past. They say that truth is stranger than fiction and when I started to put the stories together in note form I thought &quot;You couldn&#39;t make this lot up&quot;. The first 10 Chapters introduce the main families or rather their earliest relatives, starting in the late 1800&#39;s through to about the 1914&#39;s. Each of the Chapters in this novel is in chronological order It is therefore necessary to leave each family in limbo at times to maintain this date / time order within the book. This is the story of four families and how some of them went from rags to riches and back again several times whilst others never made any wealth at all. It is the story of their trials and tribulations, the inadvertent interactions between the families and famous historical figures throughout history from the late nineteenth century to the very beginning of the twenty first century." />
