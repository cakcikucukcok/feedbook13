  <title>Venezuela Confesses - Janelle Daley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Janelle Daley is 19 years of age, lives in Ajax Ontario and she is currently in school for broadcasting and film. She hopes in the future to become a script writer, or a director for music videos or movies.  When she was younger she didnt know her passion for writing until a teacher brought it out of her. Being a young black female, who was forced into a stereotype and told repeatedly that she wasnt going to amount to anything, she didnt have anywhere to turn but to a paper and pen. Her first official poetry contest was won in high school around grade 9 and every since then she couldnt stop. It quickly transformed from a hobby, into a passion and then straight into an addiction. No matter where she was or who she was with nothing stopped her from writing. Her mother had no idea that she wrote, and when she finally showed her the collection of poems was she in awe. Her father knew right away that this was something she would strive in. He is definitely someone who has encouraged her and pushed her to the goals she is accomplishing today. Janelle is someone who can be related to in every aspect of life." />
