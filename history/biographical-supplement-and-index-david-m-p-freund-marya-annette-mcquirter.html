  <title>Biographical Supplement and Index - David M. P. Freund, Marya Annette McQuirter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 10 volumes of The Young Oxford History of African Americans describe how black Americans shaped and changed the history of this nation. Starting in 1502, more than a century before the day in 1619 when 19 Africans stepped off a Dutch ship in Jamestown, Virginia, the series ends with the relationship between West Indian immigrants and African Americans in large cities like New York in the late 20th century.  This ready reference provides the perfect ending to a comprehensive history of African Americans. Included are the master index for the series and an extensive list of historic sites and museums related to the history of African Americans. The bulk of the volume, however, contains the personal histories of many of the people who appear in the previous 10 volumes. Each biography takes a close look at the famous and the lesser-known, revealing the backgrounds, experiences, and contributions of African Americans who were involved in the key events in American history. In addition to well-known facts, the biographies include much here that will surprise and fascinate readers. Muhammad Alis brash and playful public persona earned him the nickname the Louisville Lip; Bill Cosby got his start while working in a Philadelphia coffee-house; and Madam C. J. Walker owned a mail-order and beauty school company that became one of the most profitable independently-owned businesses in the country around 1910. The portraits are as varied as the history itself, setting former slaves next to committed civil rights workers, prize-winning poets next to successful politicians.  Volume 11 of The Young Oxford History of African Americans completes the fascinating and compelling story of nearly five centuries of African-American history. It is an exceptional resource for young adults and all who value the remarkable accomplishments of African Americans." />
