      <meta name="description" content="What do children really want their parents to know, and what do children need to grow into thriving adults? Most parents have a deep desire to do what’s best for their children, but unfortunately kids don’t come with instruction manuals. Diana Loomans and her daughter, Julia Godoy, are here to help. They offer twelve powerful keys to raising a happy, responsible, and fulfilled child, including:
Teach by example
Allow room to grow and make mistakes
Give acknowledgment and show appreciation
Use positive discipline with respect
