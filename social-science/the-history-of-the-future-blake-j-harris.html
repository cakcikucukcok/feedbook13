  <title>The History of the Future - Blake J. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dramatic, larger-than-life true story behind the founding of Oculus and its quest for virtual reality, by the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Console Wars.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From iconic books like &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt; to blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, virtual reality has long been hailed as the ultimate technology. But outside of a few research labs and military training facilities, this tantalizing vision of the future was nothing but science fiction. Until 2012, when Oculus founder Palmer Luckey&amp;#8212;then just a rebellious teenage dreamer living alone in a camper trailer&amp;#8212;invents a device that has the potential to change everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of a videogame legend, a serial entrepreneur and many other colorful characters, Luckey&amp;#8217;s scrappy startup kickstarts a revolution and sets out to bring VR to the masses. As with most underdog stories, things don&amp;#8217;t quite go according to plan. But what happens next turns out to be the ultimate entrepreneurial journey: a tale of battles won and lost, lessons learned and neverending twists and turns&amp;#8212;including an unlikely multi-billion-dollar acquisition by Facebook&amp;#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, which shakes up the landscape in Silicon Valley and gives Oculus the chance to forever change our reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on over a hundred interviews with the key players driving this revolution, &lt;em&gt;The History of the Future&lt;/em&gt; weaves together a rich, cinematic narrative that captures the breakthroughs, breakdowns and human drama of trying to change the world. The result is a super accessible and supremely entertaining look at the birth of a game-changing new industry. &lt;/p&gt;" />
