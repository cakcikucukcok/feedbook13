      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His crimes . . . &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The devil smiled in his craft &lt;br /&gt;
As the driver lost control. &lt;br /&gt;
All the while, he just laughed, &lt;br /&gt;
Thought he gained one more soul. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A mothers worst nightmare, &lt;br /&gt;
Birthed just before sunrise. &lt;br /&gt;
No phone call could dare &lt;br /&gt;
Soften this mothers surprise. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The car wrapped around &lt;br /&gt;
That phone pole, like saran. &lt;br /&gt;
For years in the future, &lt;br /&gt;
Injurys what would stand. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fourteen weeks in a coma, &lt;br /&gt;
Therapy for three years. &lt;br /&gt;
Learning everything over, &lt;br /&gt;
Brain injury posted fears. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learning how to walk, &lt;br /&gt;
How to think, read, and write, &lt;br /&gt;
He read books like a hawk, &lt;br /&gt;
Praying things end up right. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could he ever come back? &lt;br /&gt;
Or will misery stand? &lt;br /&gt;
Who could come fix the tracks? &lt;br /&gt;
Who would give him a hand? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could his life come around &lt;br /&gt;
If he wept on the curb? &lt;br /&gt;
Will his tears just make a sound, &lt;br /&gt;
Or is his prayer not heard? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But he came from the heights &lt;br /&gt;
To swoop down to his depths, &lt;br /&gt;
To help make his life right, &lt;br /&gt;
Stand him up with his breath. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now he lives in his heart &lt;br /&gt;
Ever since faith met time. &lt;br /&gt;
He gave him a new start, &lt;br /&gt;
His glory in his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
