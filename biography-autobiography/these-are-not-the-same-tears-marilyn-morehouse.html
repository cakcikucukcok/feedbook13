  <title>These Are Not the Same Tears - Marilyn Morehouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. 
Psalm 30:5 
Depression, disappointments, divorce, and deliveranceall in one book. I had to faith it till I made it. My desire is to use my life as the vehicle to get someone dealing with depression, abuse, and divorce over to a place where they can move forward in God. There is life after it all! I am a witness.
God didnt want me to take my journey personally; this was bigger than me. My pain was for a purpose, and I was handpicked for the journey. Ive had mountaintop-high and valley-low experiences, but they were not for me. They were for someone else. God knew the plans he had for my life, and it included a platform for people who feel like they cannot persevere.
As women, we put on masks and we pretend real good, but we are no good for anybody walking dead! Walking dead and empty just to say we have a man, a marriage, and a materialistic life. When you read my book, you will see that in the midst of the storm, God propped me up and pushed me through. If God did it for me, he will do it for you, because he has no respect of persons. Just read it because God got the glory, but now I am telling my story. Not to demean anyone in my book but to help deliver everyone I encounter who is battling with what life dealt them: a hand that seems to be the losing hand." />
