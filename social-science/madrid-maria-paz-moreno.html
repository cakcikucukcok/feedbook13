  <title>Madrid - Maria Paz Moreno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the capital city of Spain, Madrid is nowadays considered one of the most interesting &amp;ldquo;food towns&amp;rdquo; in the world. This is perhaps due to the wide variety of specialty dishes that its cuisine boasts, ranging from the old-fashioned and traditional to the modern, and even the futuristic; a cuisine that has consistently received high praise from the likes of New York Times&amp;rsquo; critic Mark Bittman and TV celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and Mario Battali, to name just a few. But how did a once humble and unsophisticated city like Madrid become the vibrant food metropolis that it is today? How did contemporary &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;madrile&amp;ntilde;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cuisine come to be, and what are its main identifying dishes? What role have its legendary restaurants, caf&amp;eacute;s and markets played in putting Madrid in the map as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s top food destinations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maria Paz Moreno looks at the gastronomical history of Madrid throughout the ages. She traces the historical origins and evolution of Madrid&amp;rsquo;s cuisine, exploring major trends, most innovative chefs, restaurants and dishes, and telling the story of this fascinating city from the point of view of a food lover. She discusses the diverse influences that have shaped Madrid&amp;rsquo;s cuisine over the centuries, including the introduction of foods from the New World since the 16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; century, the transition from famines to abundance during the second part of the 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; century, the revolution of the Michelin-starred young chefs at the beginning of the 21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; century, and how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;madrile&amp;ntilde;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rsquo; sense of identity is built through their food. The sense of community created through communal eating experiences is also explored, focusing on the culture of sharing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;tapas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as well as traditional and avant-garde eating establishments, from restaurants to bars to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;chocolater&amp;iacute;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and even markets and festivals where food plays an important part.
