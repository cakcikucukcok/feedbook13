  <title>Being Alive - Neil Astley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being Alive&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to Neil Astley’s &lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt;, which became Britain’s most popular poetry book because it gave readers hundreds of thoughtful and passionate poems about living in the modern world. Now he has assembled this equally lively companion anthology for all those readers who’ve wanted more poems that touch the heart, stir the mind and fire the spirit. &lt;i&gt;Being Alive&lt;/i&gt; is about being human: about love and loss, fear and longing, hurt and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; didn’t just reach a broader readership, it introduced thousands of new readers to contemporary poetry, giving them an international gathering of poems of great personal force, poems with emotional power, intellectual edge and playful wit. It also brought many readers back to poetry, people who hadn’t read poetry for years because it hadn’t held their interest. &lt;i&gt;Being Alive&lt;/i&gt; gives readers an even wider selection of vivid, brilliantly diverse contemporary poetry from around the world. A companion anthology, &lt;i&gt;Being Human&lt;/i&gt; (2011), completed this poetry trilogy. &lt;i&gt;Essential Poems from the &lt;/i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;i&gt; Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; (2012) selects 100 poems from all three anthologies, a third from each. These anthologies have been welcomed not only by poets but by a wide range of well-known people respected for their work in fields other than poetry – all avid readers of poetry. They want to recommend these books above all other anthologies of contemporary poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;I love &lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; and keep going back to it. &lt;i&gt;Being Alive&lt;/i&gt; is just as vivid, strongly present and equally beautifully organised. But this new book feels even more alive – I think it has a heartbeat, or maybe that’s my own thrum humming along with the music of these poets. Sitting alone in a room with these poems is to be assured that you are not alone, you are not crazy (or if you are, you’re not the only one who thinks this way!) I run home to this book to argue with it, find solace in it, to locate myself in the world again.&#39; – Meryl Streep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Truly startling and powerful poems.’ – Mia Farrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘These poems distil the human heart as nothing else… &lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the point of poetry. It’s invigorating and makes me proud of being human.’ – Jane Campion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; is a blessing of a book. The title says it all. I have long waited for just this kind of setting down of poems. Has there ever been such a passionate anthology? These are poems that hunt you down with the solace of their recognition.’ – Anne Michaels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent anthology. The last time I was so excited, engaged and enthralled by a collection of poems was when I first encountered &lt;i&gt;The Rattle Bag&lt;/i&gt;. I can’t think of any other anthology that casts its net so widely, or one that has introduced me to so many vivid and memorable poems.’ – Philip Pullman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Usually if you say a book is “inspirational” that means it’s New Agey and soft at the center. This astonishingly rich anthology, by contrast, shows that what is edgy, authentic and provocative can also awaken the spirit and make its readers quick with consciousness. In these pages I discovered many new writers, and I’ve decided I’m now in love with our troublesome epoch if it can produce poems of such genius.’ – Edmund White&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Staying Alive&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful testament to Neil Astley’s lifetime in poetry, and to the range and courage of his taste. It’s also, of course, a testament to poetry itself: to its powers to engross and move us, to its ability to challenge and brace us, and to its exultation. Everyone who cares about poetry should own this book.’ – Andrew Motion&lt;/p&gt;" />
