  <title>Murder at the School Musical - Bruce Kimmel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adriana Hofstetter is back and still marching to the beat of her own sixteen-year-old band. When Hollywood High School puts on a production of The Music Man, Adriana is there doing a story for the school paper. But when Bethany Miller, a student and cast member who has an unhealthy addiction to Instagram, doesnt come home from school and remains missing, Adriana goes on the hunt to find out what happened.&lt;br /&gt;Talking to irritating students, baffled teachers, and doubting detectives, Adriana is having no luck piecing anything together. With each passing day looking worse for Bethany Miller, Adriana must use all her wiles in trying to solve what happened. And then she receives a note, a one-word note: Stop. And then another threatening note is left on her apartment door. Can Adriana find the culprit before the culprit comes after her?&lt;br /&gt;Of course, best friend Billy Feldman is there to lend his support while playing one of the leads in The Music Man, mother Margaret is there to keep her eye on Adriana while listening to her loud, classic rock-and-roll, and Detectives Ramirez and Coyne are there to listen to and question what Adriana discovers. &lt;br /&gt;With colorful depictions of Hollywood, Adrianas trademark sense of humor, and a crime to be solved, Murder at The Music Man is funny, suspenseful, and a cautionary tale of addiction to social media.&lt;/p&gt;" />
