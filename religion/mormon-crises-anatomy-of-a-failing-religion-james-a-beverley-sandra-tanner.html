  <title>Mormon Crises: Anatomy of a Failing Religion - James A Beverley, Sandra Tanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mitt Romney&#39;s run for President of the United States and the recent success of the Broadway play &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; has created enormous interest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In spite of enormous media focus during this so-called Mormon Moment, coverage has been often shallow and misleading, even from the LDS Church. Few reporters dug deep enough to deal with the evidence that the Mormon Church is in a deep crisis, not only because of members leaving but because of increasing proof of lies, fraud, false teaching, and criminality at the start of Mormonism.   In Mormon Crisis Jim Beverley deals with major issues about Joseph Smith, the first LDS prophet. He provides a sustained critique of Mormon Scripture, examines flaws in the LDS understanding of Church leadership, and probes unique doctrines and practices, including the secret temple ceremonies. The book offers a serious indictment of the LDS belief system but also presents a way out of the current crisis facing one of America`s most famous and controversial religions." />
