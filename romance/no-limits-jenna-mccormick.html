  <title>No Limits - Jenna McCormick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A unique man reaches through space and time.  .  .and a passionate woman responds as only she can.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take Me There&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Genevieve Luzon wants is to be loved by one man, a seemingly impossible task in New-New York City. Sure, she can buy sex as easily as she can order pizza on a Friday night, but finding a forever kind of love is no easy feat for the unemployed off-world vacation coordinator. Needing a job, Gen enlists as a pleasure companion at the premium escort service, Illustra, never dreaming that it will turn her life upside down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During Gen&#39;s first training session, a man steps out of a living flame, brought to scorching life by her own hidden longings. Rhys is an empath, a man with the extraordinary ability to understand and fulfill her most secret desires. He is everything Gen has wanted--except available. Rhys is on a dangerous mission, one that might claim his life. But Gen is not about to let something she&#39;s wanted for so long get away now that she knows how good it feels.  .  ." />
