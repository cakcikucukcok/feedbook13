      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Creatures&lt;/em&gt; will fall head over heels for &lt;em&gt;Glass Heart&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Garvey, with its blend of breathless suspense, passionate romance, and magic.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cold Kiss,&lt;/em&gt; Wren Darby learned she had powers strong enough to bring her dead boyfriend back to life. She thought she had to keep these powers a secret from everyone, until she met Gabriel, a mind reader who instantly learned her deepest secret.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;In the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Glass Heart&lt;/em&gt;, Wren is torn between her love for Gabriel and the rush of exploring her powers. When Gabriel warns Wren that her powers are getting out of control, Wren begins spending more time with Bay and Fiona, whose magic is wild, exhilarating&amp;#8212;and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;And by the time Wren realizes Gabriel was right, she may already have lost him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
