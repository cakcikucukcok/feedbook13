&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was living a secret life. Four times marriedand three times divorcedhe was a notorious gambler, which Steve suspects might have something to do with his murder. However, his investigations lead him in a direction he never suspected. Now mixed up in fraud, terrorism, and murder, Steves life is turned upside-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He soon finds himself working to help the FBI, which could very well get him killed.
