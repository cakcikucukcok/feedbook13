  <title>The Booby Trap and Other Bits and Boobs - Dawn O&#39;Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aid of breast cancer charities. A collection of stories from famous names with one thing in common - boobs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knockers, baps, bazoomas and hooters - big ones, small ones, man boobs, boob jobs and lopsided lady lumps - every boob tells a story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From teenage diaries that will make you laugh out loud and squirm with embarrassment, to heart-breaking first-hand celebrity confessions,  journalist and author Dawn O&#39;Porter is joined by celebrities such as  Caitlin Moran, Chris O&#39;Dowd, Jameela Jamil and Sarah Millican in a big book of all things booby. Bestselling authors also contribute with writing from Maureen Johnson, Marian Keyes, Patrick Ness, Laura Dockrill, James Dawson, Will Hill, Maude Apatow and Benjamin Zephaniah. This is a full-frontal insight into breasts, nips, pecs and all the other bits and boobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;Dawn O&#39;Porter is a broadcaster, novelist and print journalist who lives in London with her husband Chris, cat Lilu and dog Potato. She has made thirteen documentaries about all sorts of things, including polygamy, childbirth, geishas, body image, breast cancer and even the movie DIRTY DANCING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn has written for various UK newspapers and magazines including GRAZIA and STYLIST. Her first novel, PAPER AEROPLANES, was published by Hot Key Books in 2013. Although Dawn lives in London she spends a lot of time in LA and travels a lot. You may have seen her dragging two huge pink suitcases with broken wheels and a Siamese cat (Lilu) in a box through international airports. At some point she plans to get new suitcases - the cat, however, has a few years left in her yet. Follow Dawn at www.dawnoporter.co.uk or on Twitter: @hotpatooties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
