  <title>The Intruder - Håkan Östlundh, Paul Norlen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Intruder&lt;/i&gt; is an unusual story about betrayal and dark secrets. The Andersson family is being sent scary letters without a sender&#39;s name. Who could possibly want to harm them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotland policeman Fredrik Broman and his colleagues take the threats seriously, but cannot rule out  the possibility that it is all a tasteless joke. When the threats escalate and the couple&#39;s daughter disappears, all doubts vanish. This is for real. And it is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the police pressure the husband, a complicated family history is revealed. What really made him return to the small island after his successful career as an international photographer? Is it really someone nearby that wants to harm the family, or does the threat come from elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed crime novelist Håkan Östlundh combines high literary quality with high-end suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
