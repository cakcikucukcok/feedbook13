  <title>The Purple Pony - Marian Chapman, Lawrence Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;King Ebon likes horses.  He is especially fond of his new purple horse, Majesty.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Majesty, knows that he is special, not only in color and size but because he can speak and he has psychic powers.  He defiantly refuses to let the royal blacksmith put horseshoes onto him.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;The King concerned for his horses safety will not ride him without the shoes.  But this causes the King great sadness.  A reward is offered to the blacksmith that can shoe the horse.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;A brave young boy, {Hans} sets out to try to claim the reward.  During his journey he encounters many obstacles and traps.  He must also cross through the dreaded Mystic Forest where he is befriended by an elf and fairies.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;The conflict ensues of good versus evil.  There are lots of twists and turns to heighten the suspense.  Add couple of villains and a wizard to the mix of characters, and read on to find out why the Purple Pony is a story that will delight children and the child within all of us.  As we watch Hans discover the most valuable reward is the love and friendship of our family and friends.&lt;/P&gt;" />
