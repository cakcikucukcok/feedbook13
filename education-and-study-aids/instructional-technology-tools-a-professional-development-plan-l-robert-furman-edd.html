  <title>Instructional Technology Tools: a Professional Development Plan - L. Robert Furman EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The use of instructional technology in twenty-first-century classrooms is not a subject to be debated. Rather, it needs to be embraced as a standard practice rather than an enriching activity. In Instructional Technology Tools: A Professional Development Plan, author L. Robert Furman presents a comprehensive guide to help educators embrace the use of instructional technology tools in the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering the typical questions often posed by teachers and staff, Furman emphasizes the practical use of technology and introduces a breakthrough development called E-ProDev Days for offsite electronic professional development. He gives administrators the tools necessary to conduct fulfilling and meaningful professional development days, in-house or electronically, revolving around technology. Instructional Technology Tools: A Professional Development Plan also includes&lt;/p&gt;
	professional development lesson plans; 
	tutorials for teachers and students;
	sample sites where examples of each e-tool are available to share;
	addresses to obtain the e-tools. 
&lt;p&gt;Presenting a logical and practical approach to teaching a staff how to successfully use e-tools in their classroom, Instructional Technology Tools: A Professional Development Plan helps administrators help teachers to enhance their classrooms, manage time, organize themselves, and save money. &lt;/p&gt;" />
