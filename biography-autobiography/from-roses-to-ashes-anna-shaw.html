  <title>From Roses to Ashes - Anna Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A True Story About Joy, Tragedy, Inspiration and the Choices We Make . . . 
At every stage of your life, crucial decisions need to be made. We all seek balance and yearn for a life that will guide us in the right direction. But some of us may have taken the wrong path and paid a severe price. I am one of them. Many have seen my life as a sequence of tragedies and bad luck. I am someone who has drifted from one mistake to another, which has led to a domino effect, and what makes the whole situation even more dramatic is that I was born into a life of wealth and comfort. 
The purpose of this book is to prevent you from falling into an endless abyss of despair with no vision of a future. If you heed my words, I promise that you can apply them from the moment you finish the book. You may not see it today or tomorrow or ever if you are truly lucky, but most of you will reach a point in your life where you have to make a critical choice, and my goal is to prevent you from making the one that you might regret for the rest of your life.
