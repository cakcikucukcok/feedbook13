Ultimately these leaders foster a team approach through a culture of participantship. They regard leadership as an action rather than a position. They see the future of leadership as collective, lateral, and integral and work with others from an abundance mentality. These leaders move forward in learning, using neuroscience findings to promote actions grounded in brain research and assuming responsibility as a way of being for the organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
