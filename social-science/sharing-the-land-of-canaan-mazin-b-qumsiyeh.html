  <title>Sharing the Land of Canaan - Mazin B. Qumsiyeh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Mazin Qumsiyeh brings to light many forgotten and willfully buried facts about the origins of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.&#39; Norman Finkelstein
&#39;A tour-de-force.&#39; Naseer Aruri, Professor Emeritus and author of &#39;Dishonest Broker&#39;
&#39;An erudite work of extensive scholarship, enormous scope, searing honesty, and intellectual audacity. ... Breathtaking!&#39; Dr. Hanan Ashrawi
There is no more compelling and dramatic unfolding story, with more profound international ramifications, than the conflict in the Middle East.  
Sharing the Land of Canaan is a critical examination of the core issues of the conflict that dares to put forward a radical but logical solution: that a shared state is the best way to achieve justice and peace for Israelis and Palestinians. 
Mazin B. Qumsiyeh, a human rights activist based at Yale University, offers an overview of the issues at stake, and outlines his vision for a lasting peace based on upholding the principles of human rights for all. Tackling taboo subjects, myths and obstacles, he argues convincingly that apartheid in the form of a two-state solution is no longer a feasible way to achieve enduring peace. 
At this critical time, when the &#39;road map&#39; to peace looks more uncertain than ever, this book provides a refreshing counterpoint to the failed strategies of the past. It is a direct and accessible account of the history - and mythology - of the fabled &#39;Land of Canaan&#39;, which lays out hopeful ideas for the future of this truly multiethnic and multicultural region." />
