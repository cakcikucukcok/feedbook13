  <title>JAY-Z - Michael Eric Dyson, Pharrell, Pharrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOW A &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, AND&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PUBLISHER&#39;S WEEKLY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dyson writes with the affection of a fan but the rigor of an academic. ... Using extensive passages from Jay-Z&#39;s lyrics, &#39;Made in America&#39; examines the rapper&#39;s role as a poet, an aesthete, an advocate for racial justice and a business, man, but devotes much of its energy to Hova the Hustler.&quot; --&lt;b&gt;Allison Stewart, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dyson&#39;s incisive analysis of JAY-Z&#39;s brilliance not only offers a brief history of hip-hop&#39;s critical place in American culture, but also hints at how we can best move forward.&quot;&lt;b&gt; --Questlove&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAY-Z: Made in America&lt;/i&gt; is the fruit of Michael Eric Dyson&#39;s decade of teaching the work of one of the greatest poets this nation has produced, as gifted a wordsmith as Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and Rita Dove. But as a rapper, he&#39;s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he&#39;s been for so long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z&#39;s career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he&#39;s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z&#39;s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many ways, this is JAY-Z&#39;s America as much as it&#39;s Pelosi&#39;s America, or Trump&#39;s America, or Martin Luther King&#39;s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring a Foreword by Pharrell&lt;/p&gt;" />
