  <title>The Second Talmage Powell Crime MEGAPACK ®: 25 More Classic Mystery Stories - Talmage Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are delighted to present our second collection of Talmage Powell mystery short stories! Powell (1920-2000) was one of the all-time great mystery writers of the pulp magazines (and later the digest mystery magazines). He claimed to have written more than 500 short stories, and we have no reason to doubt him -- we are working on a bibliography of his work and have documented 373 magazine stories so far...and who knows how many are out there under pseudonyms or buried in obscure magazines? He wrote his first novel, The Smasher, in 1959. He went on to pen 11 more novels under his own name, 4 as &quot;Ellery Queen,&quot; and 2 novelizations of the hit TV series Mission: Impossible. Clearly, though, short stories were his first love.&lt;P&gt; Included here are 20 more of his best crime tales, including:&lt;P&gt; THE VITAL ELEMENT&lt;BR&gt; PSYCHO-SYMPTOMS&lt;BR&gt; STRANGER&#39;S GIFT&lt;BR&gt; THE WAY OUT&lt;BR&gt; IN THE HOUSE OF RATS&lt;BR&gt; TO SPARE A LIFE&lt;BR&gt; THE INSPIRATION&lt;BR&gt; EASY MARK&lt;BR&gt; GATOR BAIT&lt;BR&gt; THE COMMUNE&lt;BR&gt; THE DELICATE VICTIM&lt;BR&gt; TRIAL RUN&lt;BR&gt; THE TIP-OFF&lt;BR&gt; THE ULTIMATE PREY&lt;BR&gt; NEW NEIGHBOR&lt;BR&gt; TILL DEATH DO NOT US PART&lt;BR&gt; HOPE CHEST&lt;BR&gt; THE HOLDUP&lt;BR&gt; A WAY WITH A WILL&lt;BR&gt; THE BEACON&lt;P&gt; If you enjoy this book, search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see the 240+ other entries in the series, covering mysteries, science fiction, fantasy, westerns, classics, adventure stories, and much, much more!" />
