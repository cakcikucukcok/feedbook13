History is repeating itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of America&amp;#39;s five ideals are still being tested. Our liberty was tested in the Revolutionary War. Our equality was tested in the Civil War.

The great experiment cannot fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We the people are America&amp;#39;s true king and we must start acting like it. We must put our differences aside and support the only anti-donor class president, Donald Trump. Together with an Article V. Convention we can perfect this union and finally take our thrown that was given to us by our Founding Fathers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
