  <title>To Become a Rich American - Stanley B. Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspThis novel is the story of a European immigrant woman, very charming 
and attractive to&lt;BR&gt;
men, attempting to become a rich American. It is also the story of Rick Stevens search, 
despite&lt;BR&gt;
his sexual hang-ups, for the ideal wife.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspKert von Fielding was in her mid thirties when she made her first 
voyage aboard the MS&lt;BR&gt;
Gripsholm, sailing from Helsinki, Finland, to New York City.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspKert had majored in languages at Helsinki University where she 
earned both a B.A. and an&lt;BR&gt;
M.A., and had later worked as a translator. She knew five langagesFinish, Swedish, English,&lt;BR&gt;
French, and German. She hoped someday to obtain translating work in New York City.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspBut this first time in the states, she visited her cousins in Salem 
on the Lake, a small town&lt;BR&gt;
in Ohio on the banks of Lake Erie. While there, she made the acquaintance of Mart Appleby,&lt;BR&gt;
ten years her junior, and the son of the highly esteemed and supposedly wealthy Municipal&lt;BR&gt;
Court Judge of the townCalvin W. Appleby II. Their friendship, during the summer of 1957,&lt;BR&gt;
ripened into an intense love affair, involving a lot of sex. She fell madly in love with Mart&lt;BR&gt;
Appleby and thought he loved her in return. She was mistaken, but she kept sending him love&lt;BR&gt;
letters after he went to the West Virginia Institute of Technology where he was employed as a&lt;BR&gt;
psychology/sociology assistant professor.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspMart did not answer any of Kerts letters. Then, failing at this 
affair, she turned to his older half-&lt;BR&gt;
brother,Rick Stevens, who was closer to her age, five years her junior. Rick was interested but 
wary.&lt;BR&gt;
She discussed with him her plan to become an American citizen by marrying an American.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspRick, a new high school science teacher, was conservative and not 
nearly as daring as his&lt;BR&gt;
younger half-brother Mart. Kert definitely preferred Mart as a mate instead of Rick. But shed&lt;BR&gt;
marry Rick as a means to an endobtaining her citizenshipand then leave. She figured she&lt;BR&gt;
could hide in New York City.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspWhen her VISA expired she returned to Helsinki, Finland. While there 
she wrote&lt;BR&gt;
numerous letters to Rick, finally writing lovey-dovey type letters. She told him she would&lt;BR&gt;
return to visit.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspShe returned to New York City the next year aboard the MS Gripsholm. 
During the&lt;BR&gt;
seven-day passage she had a shipboard romance with a handsome and congenial man in his&lt;BR&gt;
mid thirties, Chad Power, an assistant professor of English at Hunter College in NYC and&lt;BR&gt;
the son of a multimillionaire.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspWithout giving away any more of the story, suffice it to say that 
Kert, using sex and her feminine&lt;BR&gt;
wiles and machinations, managed to be married to two handsome virile men at the same time,&lt;BR&gt;
without either of them being aware of her duplicity, and to obtain her citizenship twice.&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspDid Kert ever become rich? You will need to read the book to find 
out. And, please dont skip around." />
