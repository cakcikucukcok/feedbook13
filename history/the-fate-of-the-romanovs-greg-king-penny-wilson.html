  <title>The Fate of the Romanovs - Greg King, Penny Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abundant, newly discovered sources shatter long-held beliefs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 revealed, among many other things, a hidden wealth of archival documents relating to the imprisonment and eventual murder of Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their children. Emanating from sources both within and close to the Imperial Family as well as from their captors and executioners, these often-controversial materials have enabled a new and comprehensive examination of one the pivotal events of the twentieth century and the many controversies that surround it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on a careful analysis of more than 500 of these previously unpublished documents, along with numerous newly discovered photos, The Fate of the Romanovs makes compelling revisions to many long-held beliefs about the Romanovs&#39; final months and moments. This powerful account includes:&lt;br&gt;* Surprising evidence that Anastasia may, indeed, have survived&lt;br&gt;* Diary entries made by Nicholas and Alexandra during their captivity&lt;br&gt;* Revelations of how the Romanovs were betrayed by trusted servants&lt;br&gt;* A reconstruction of daily life among the prisoners at Ipatiev House&lt;br&gt;* Strong evidence that the Romanovs were not brutalized by their captors&lt;br&gt;* Statements from admitted participants in the murders" />
