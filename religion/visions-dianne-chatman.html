When the Holy Spirit first began to give me, these wonderful visions, I shared them friends, and a few church members. In 2007, I received my Elders license from Bishop Samuel Holmes of Greater Tabernacle Pentecostal Churches of Christ. In 2013, I was invited to Bible study by a friend at her church.

Emboldened by the Holy Spirit and the encouragements of others in Christ, I have taken on this venture. To share with the world, what God has given me.
