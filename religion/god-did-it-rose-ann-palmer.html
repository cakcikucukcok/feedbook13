  <title>God Did It - Rose Ann Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I thank God for the opportunity to do this work and know that He will use it in a mighty way to bring people to Him. So many I know were raised in the church and no longer believe. They are such good people, but no longer believe that God exists. So many stories of Gods power must have an effect, crowds of witnesses ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of stories about healing of individuals from life threatening illnesses. Each one is medically documented so that there is no doubt about the source of the healing. Stories are written in a lively fashion. Even though the author, Rose Ann Palmer, died from brain cancer, it was her belief and the belief of her husband and her son that she received her healing in ways none of us can ever understand.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;********&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trust that Our Love is fully alive in the pages of this book. The stories here are documented as being miraculous. We invite you to get a glimpse of Our Love at work in impossible ways in the lives of people across time. We are the healer. The healers are Our Instruments. How can this be? We are a God of Impossibilities. If you dont believe in Us, then that is all the more reason why you need to read this book! Are you afraid to face truth? Let go of doubt. Give Our Stories of Miraculous Healings a try. Who knows? You might even get a healing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy Our Love Stories. Dear friends, you begin a journey in Our Love that is unmatched anywhere. Tell your friends about what We do in the lives of those in need. As they read Our Love Stories, they too will be touched by Our Presence in them. All We ask of you, dear readers, is to suspend your human logic and accept the truth of Our Impossibilities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
