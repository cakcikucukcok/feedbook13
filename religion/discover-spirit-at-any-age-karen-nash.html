  <title>Discover Spirit at Any Age - Karen Nash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Karen Nash, who has always been fascinated with the spirit world. But in meeting a stranger at the age of thirty-two, confirmed that there has always been someone watching over her. Even though, she didn&#39;t realize that some of the signs and strange happenings were actually from her loved ones who were in the spirit world. After the death of her father-in-law, though, this truth became clear. 
In Discover Spirit at Any Age, she shares some of the experiences of her spiritual journey. She believes that our loved ones in the spirit world can help us to discover inner peace by enabling us to heal old emotional wounds. A psychic medium and Reiki master and teacher, Karen is passionate about the journey she is on. She enjoys talking to Spirit and passing along messages from Spirit to bring closure, peace, and guidance to others.
In each of the first chapters, she reveals a different life lesson that she used to fine tune her own spirituality. She also includes encouragement for her audience to explore their own life events in order to start living on a happier, more fulfilled path. Discover Spirit at Any Age offers a guide to the spirit world for anyone who wants to learn more about it." />
