      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Porter was a top-of-the-lineManhattan antiques dealer until her ex-husband and his lover&#39;s flagrantly criminal scam left her reputation in tatters. Now, using a new name, Molly Doyle, she&#39;s starting over a continent away in a rundown antiques shop in cozy Carmel, California. Molly is determined to make the best of it. But the early antiques bird sometimes gets more than the worm, and one prompt arrival places her at a murder site with a corpse in her arms. After she turns up at a second seemingly unrelated death, the abrasive new police chief considers Molly the prime suspect. Now the only way to clear her name is for Molly to find her own path to a killer, which will leave her either exonerated ... or dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
