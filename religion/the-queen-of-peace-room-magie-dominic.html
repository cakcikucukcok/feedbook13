  <title>The Queen of Peace Room - Magie Dominic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; What is memory, and where is it stored in the body? Can a room be symbolic of a lifetime? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Memories are like layers of your skin or layers of paint on a canvas. In &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Peace Room&lt;/i&gt;, Magie Dominic peels away these layers as she explores her life, that of a Newfoundlander turned New Yorker, an artist and a writer — and frees herself from the memories of her violent past. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On an eight-day retreat with Catholic nuns in a remote location safe from the outside world, she exposes, and captures, fifty years of violent memories and weaves them into a tapestry of unforgettable images. The room she inhabits while there is called The Queen of Peace Room; it becomes, for her, a room of sanctuary. She examines Newfoundland in the 1940s and 1950s and New York in the 1960s; her confrontations with violence, incest, and rape; the devastating loss of friends to AIDS; and the relationship between life and art. These memories she finds stored alongside memories of nature’s images of trees pulling themselves up from their roots and fleeing the forest; storms and ley lines, and skies bursting with star-like eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Peace Room&lt;/i&gt;, from a very personal perspective, Magie Dominic explores violence against women in the second half of the twentieth century, and in doing so unearths the memory of a generation. In eight days, she captures half a century. &lt;/p&gt;" />
