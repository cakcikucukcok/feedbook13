  <title>Uncreated Timeless Self of Radiant Emptiness - Onliness Consciousness and Commentaries - Martin Treon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Buy on sale at www.bookfinder.com for $15.95
If you are interested in transcendental Enlightenment (in Sahaja Samadhi, Satori, or Nirvana), in Awakening to Nondual Self of Wisdom and Compassion (in the co-enacted worldspace of Nondual Spirit-as-Sprit Consciousness Realization) then youll be interested in this book entitled Uncreated Timeless Self of Radiant Emptiness - Onliness Consciousness and Commentaries by Martin Treon, Ph. D. Available at www.bookfinder.com for $15.95. 
This new book, which includes and integrates pre-modern, modern, and post-modern insights, is not about any particular established religious tradition or sect, is not about a new age  superstition-based idea or trend, and is not about an ego-based self awareness or self-improvement program. Rather, it deals with transformational Realization of that transcendent Self that You always, already are, which is All and None, Each and Every, Here and Now. 
Order it online at www.amazon.com or www.bookfinder.com ($15.95 at this site), buy.com, borders.com, bn.com, A1books.com, half.com, abebooks.com, albris.com, valorebooks.com, biblio.com, www.xlibris.com ($19.99), or email: Orders@Xlibris.com, or call Xlibris at 1-888-795-4274. 
This book is written for individuals interested in transformational transcendent spiritual development, insight and understanding. Part II of this book also includes 64 Tao of Onliness I Ching commentaries, one for each of the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching. These are intended for use by individuals for Tao of Onliness I Ching consultation. Following are excerpts from this book that characterize its content and perspective:   
&quot;From Onliness perspective, I Ching consultation is an early-stage form of quiet and solitary meditation-contemplation. Enacted in this way, it can be a means of viewing and better understanding your own intuitive Awareness and Experience. There is nothing magical about it; it is not a fortune-teller game (i.e., I Ching can not tell you what will happen in the future, but sometimes suggests what potentially, under certain circumstances, could or may happen at some future time). Approached in a peaceful, non-attached, unbiased and open state of mind, I Ching consultation can help you to see into the deeper nature of your own Consciousness.&quot;
&quot;Tao of Onliness conception is primarily rooted in Mahayana Buddhism (especially Zen Buddhism) and Taoism, with substantial contribution to its formulation and structure based on consultation of the I Ching. However, Onliness also attempts to honor and include expressions of the mystical and transcendental Wisdom and Compassion from all of the widely recognized major spiritual-religious traditions of the world.&quot;
&quot;Onliness Consciousness concerns the Self of no-self, this Being that is all beings. . .
There is here no claim that Onliness theory and perspective is in any sense absolute, ultimate, eternal or universal in any pre-given sense. The co-constructed worldspace realm-waves of consciousness discussed in Onliness are developmental and evolutionary in nature, not pre-created, pre-given, pre-designed or pre-ordained. Rather, Onliness claims that the co-created and co-enacted unfolding of these realm-waves of Spirits transcendent Self-remembering Consciousness emerge and evolve over vast periods of time, gradually establishing themselves as patterned realm-wave stages (worldspaces of consciousness); pathways or &quot;trails&quot; so to speak.&quot;
&quot;In Onliness, the underlying central message is the same one that was expressed 2,500 years ago by Shakyamuni Buddha upon his Realization of Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree: Marvelous! Marvelous! All beings are already fully enlightened! It is only because of their delusion that they dont realize this. (Mitchell, 1991). It is a message that is essentially the same as has been variously expressed by many other Sages from different mystical spiritual traditions up to the present day. It is the message of Self-as" />
