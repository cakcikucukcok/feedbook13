  <title>Pinned! - Charles W. Massie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mark Casey, a native New Yorker and a gentleman, wants to get out of his home state and live in another part of the world. He is attracted to a small town Kentucky woman named Roxie, whom he meets on the Internet. This woman seems to be the girl of his dreams - beautiful, sensual, ambitious and funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having a series of talks via the Internet and by phone, he decides to pay her a visit at her Kentucky home. The meeting is magic. They fall head over heels for each other and decide to live together. Mark packs up all of his belongings and moves into her beautiful house; anticipating a life of bliss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are immediate problems as soon as he gets to his new abode. They fight, where they never did before. Roxie lies to him constantly. Their once raging sexual relationship has turned sour and they are now sleeping apart from each other. What could have caused this abyss between them, which was once a dream?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, when Roxie has had more than enough alcohol, she begins to tell Mark some of her past history. It seems that she was involved in the death of her own daughter. Her son-in-law mysteriously falls off a building after having a conversation with Roxie. Her trailer explodes nearly killing her husband. Eventually she accuses her husband of domestic violence and has him arrested. A senior citizen living with her and supporting her, suddenly kills himself with a shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark concludes that Roxie is what is called &amp;#39;A Black Widow&amp;#39;. Unfortunately for Mark, Roxie accuses him of a heinous crime and has him arrested. While he is incarcerated, she packs up all of her possessions and his possessions, and moves out of state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of flagrant injustice in a small country town. These horrifying accusations strain Mark&amp;#39;s family and friends trust, while calling their most cherished beliefs into serious question. The story rapidly moves along and tracks the actions of Mark himself, as well as the motivations of the calculating Roxie, the local police force, the Kentucky State Police, the county attorney, the Kentucky Attorney General and even the legal tenets of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While many truths are revealed, also exposed is the extent that some will go to dominate, possess, hold power and even cover-up their actions. This story runs from where it all began, up to Mark&amp;#39;s jury trial on crimes he didn&amp;#39;t commit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has ever dreamed of living in small-town USA and getting away from the rat-race of metropolis, this tale of one man&amp;#39;s battle against the good &amp;#39;ol boys may cause you to reconsider possibilities in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
