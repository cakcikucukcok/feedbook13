  <title>Carved in Bone - Jefferson Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a patch of ground in Tennessee dedicated to the science of death, where human remains lie exposed to be studied for their secrets. The real-life scientist who founded the &quot;Body Farm&quot; has broken cold cases and revolutionized forensics . . . and now he spins an astonishing tale inspired by his own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renowned anthropologist Dr. Bill Brockton has spent his career surrounded by death at the Body Farm. Now he&#39;s being called upon to help solve a baffling puzzle in a remote mountain community. The mummified corpse of a young woman dead for thirty years has been discovered in a cave, the body bizarrely preserved and transformed by the environment&#39;s unique chemistry. But Brockton&#39;s investigation is threatening to open old wounds among an insular people who won&#39;t forget or forgive. And a long-buried secret prematurely exposed could inflame Brockton&#39;s own guilt&amp;#8212;and the dangerous hostility of bitter enemies determined to see him fail . . . by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Fascinating Insider Information on the Body Farm!&lt;/p&gt;" />
