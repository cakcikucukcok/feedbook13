  <title>Single and Hating It...Destined and Not Denied - Denise Chand, Jennifer John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hurry, God, do not delay...Im In My 40s! has become Liya and Zenias mantra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liya, a woman after Gods own heart, has had her heart mutilated by the man she has been in a relationship with for 3 years. She claims she was blindsided...or did she turn a blind eye to the warning signs? Believing he was her Godmate, Gods choice for her, ignites an inner conflict she battles to overcome which leaves her questioning whether she has been called to a life of singleness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia, a woman of faith, patterned her life decisions by the yearly prophecies delivered each New Years Eve during church service but this year all that changed. Healing from one heartache after another, and with each passing year bringing her no closer to a Godmate, has forced her to change her thinking, which has yielded resultsshe finally met her Godmate. Unfortunately, it has put her friendship with Liya through its darkest hour.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rise or Fall the unspoken vow between them about their friendship. They stand together in the face of challenges and in celebration of each other, but will Zenias betrayal be the serrated blade that severs their bond of sisterhood? Will Liyas fear of being in her 40s, single with no children and hating it, distance her from God and Zenia? Will their friendship be able to rise from betrayal, or will it fall? Will they rise by trusting Gods timing for a Godmate, or fall due to what feels like His denial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single and Hating It...Destined and Not Denied&lt;/em&gt; breathes hope, sheds light in the darkness, quiets raging heart-storms and strengthens ones faith regardless of its Christian content. Its collection of short stories will expose the wounded heart and through the Pearls of Wisdom bring healing, restoration and wholeness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
