  <title>The Lone Star Hiking Trail: The Official Guide to the Longest Wilderness Footpath in Texas - Karen Somers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;One of the hidden jewels of Texas, the Lone Star Hiking Trail is the only long-distance National Recreation Trail in the state. At 128 miles (including loop trails), it is also the state&#39;s longest continuously marked and maintained footpath. Located in the famed Big Thicket area in east Texas, the trail is well-suited for both short and long hikes (of up to 10 days), appealing to dayhikers, overnight backpackers and long-distance hikers. The LSHT lies between the major metro centers of Houston-Galveston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, and San Antonio--home to more than 8 million people just a 2-hour drive from the trail. The author, a Texas native, is an experienced long-distance hiker who has thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, and many other nationally recognized long-distance trails throughout the U.S. This is the first guidebook to the trail and is officially endorsed and promoted by the Lone Star Hiking Trail Club.&lt;/div&gt;" />
