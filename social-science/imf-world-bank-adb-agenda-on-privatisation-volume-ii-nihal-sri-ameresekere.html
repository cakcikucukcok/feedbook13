  <title>Imf, World Bank &amp; Adb Agenda   on   Privatisation   Volume   Ii - Nihal Sri Ameresekere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Book dramatically spotlights with real case studies, the truism and reality, that politicians aspire for high political office, campaigning vociferously, avowing commitment to combat fraud and corruption, exploiting the economic anguish of poverty stricken people, however upon assuming political power, pathetically such avowed commitment becomes hypocritical hollow rhetoric, with them appallingly getting bogged down in the quagmire of corruption, vehemently castigated and denounced!  Reality is that politicians are funded and and assisted by lackeys at elections, resulting in politicians getting obligated to lackeys, blatantly seeking returns on funding and support, at the expense of the abject poor.  Case studies dealt with appallingly reveal that the idealistic agenda of IMF, World Bank and ADB pushing privatization only germinates the breeding of corruption, with such institutions becoming mere spectators, compromised to be viewed, as having aided and abetted in corruption, publicly denounced by them, ironically providing alleviation schemes for the upliftment of the abject poor.  Fraud and corruption at the highest echelons in Government, involving international parties, are shockingly revealed, with intriguing diplomatic interventions.  It is an unbelievable revelation from the stage of lofty idealism to the sublime apathy of deception, complicit with duplicity and hypocrisy, in enforcing the law unequally against opponents for political expediency, whilst those wielding power, themselves, have brazenly acted otherwise, perpetrating offences of much greater gravity, including also shielding lackeys and cronies.  Amazingly, the highest judiciary, castigating corruption, upholds the dire need for governance and enforcement of the rule of law, including against the highest in the country.  Brilliant in-depth research into real human behavior and wheeler-dealing in the upper echelons of Governments-an ideally invaluable Book for academics and professionals interested in political science, human behaviour, governance, public finance, commerce, rule of law, forensic accounting and privastisation, and for public interest activists." />
