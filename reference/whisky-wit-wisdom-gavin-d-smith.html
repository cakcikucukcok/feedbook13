  <title>Whisky, Wit &amp; Wisdom - Gavin D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book deals with the lighter and quirkier sides of whisky-making, whisky consumption, whisky over-consumption, whisky in literature, whisky and the law, and even whisky and death. A selection of leading whisky industry personalities have contributed their favourite humorous stories concerning &#39;the cratur&#39;, and the text is augmented by a series of historic Punch cartoons and modern cartoons in a wide variety of styles. Some sample entries concerning foreign countries and whisky include: Many nations have tried to copy Scotch and Irish whisk(e)y, and none more determinedly than the Japanese. One English-born former Tokyo resident recalled being asked in the 1920s by a local whisky distiller to come up with a label which would lull drinkers into believing that they were getting genuine Scotch. He suggested &#39;Guaranteed bottled in Buckingham Palace under the personal supervision of His Majesty the King.&#39; The labels were duly printed and the whisky went on sale. And: Stories are told of early Japanese whiskies with names such as &#39;King Anne&#39;, but a personal favourite concerns a whisky produced in Ecuador. One can only conjecture about the origins of the name, and speculate that perhaps a disgruntled expatriate Scotsman was asked to help choose something suitable.
