  <title>Seven Pillars of Wisdom - T. E. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&amp;quot; by T. E. Lawrence is the story of the Arab Revolt against the Turkish Empire and Lawrence&amp;#39;s role in it. Lawrence, educated at Oxford, begins by working for a museum on an archaeological dig in the Middle East at the outbreak of the First World War. He is commissioned into the British Army while at the Euphrates and is attached to the Hejaz Expeditionary Force with Lawrence functioning as the British soldier attached to the Arab leadership in the revolt against the Turks. The Arab region is a part of the Ottoman Empire at the opening of the book. Turkey is an ally of Germany in the war and England feels that helping the Arabs defeat the Turks helps England in her war against Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&amp;quot; is an unusual and rich work. It encompasses an account of the Arab Revolt against the Turks during the First World War alongside general Middle Eastern and military history, politics, adventure and drama. It is also a memoir of the soldier known as &amp;#39;Lawrence of Arabia&amp;#39;. Lawrence is a fascinating and controversial figure and his talent as a vivid and imaginative writer shines through on every page of this, his masterpiece. &amp;quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&amp;quot; provides a unique portrait of this extraordinary man and an insight into the birth of the Arab nation.&lt;br /&gt;
