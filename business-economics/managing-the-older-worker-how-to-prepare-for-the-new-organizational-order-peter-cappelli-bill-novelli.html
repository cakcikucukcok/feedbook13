  <title>Managing the Older Worker: How to Prepare for the New Organizational Order - Peter Cappelli, Bill Novelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Your organization needs older workers more than ever: They transfer knowledge between generations, transmit your company&#39;s values to new hires, make excellent mentors for younger employees, and provide a &quot;just in time&quot; workforce for special projects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yet more of these workers are reporting to people younger than they are. This presents unfamiliar challenges that--if ignored--can prevent you from attracting, retaining, and engaging older employees.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Managing the Older Worker, Peter Cappelli and William Novelli explain how companies and younger managers can maximize the value provided by older workers. The key? Recognize that boomers&#39; needs differ from younger generations - and adapt your management practices accordingly. For instance:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; Lead with mission: As employees age, they become more altruistic. Emphasize the positive impact of older workers&#39; efforts on the world around them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; Forge social connections: Many older employees keep working to maintain social relationships. Offer tasks that require interaction with others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; Provide different benefits: Tailor benefits--such as elder-care insurance programs or discount medication--to older workers&#39; interests.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on research in management, psychology, and other disciplines, Managing the Older Worker reveals who your older workers are, what they want, and how to manage them for maximum value.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
