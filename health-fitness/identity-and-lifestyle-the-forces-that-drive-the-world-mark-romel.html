  <title>Identity and Lifestyle: The Forces That Drive the World - Mark Romel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You build your lifestyle around your identity. Your identity is your fate. You are what you do, and you do what you do because of your identity. What you do constitutes your lifestyle. Most people are so busy with their lifestyle that they fail to consider whether or not their lifestyle is helping them or hindering them. You optimize yourself through having an optimal lifestyle, but how do you decide what lifestyle is best? Most people drift into lazy, easy, convenient lifestyles - acceptable to their peer group - that guarantee they will fail in life. Changing your lifestyle involves changing your identity, and that is the most difficult thing possible for average people. They don&#39;t have the will. Don&#39;t bother talking about changing the world unless you are in the business of destroying old identities and lifestyles, and creating brand new ones. As soon as you try to change a person&#39;s &quot;sacred&quot; identity, you are at war with them. Are you ready for the mother of all wars?" />
