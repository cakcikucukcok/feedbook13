  <title>Making Him L.O.R.D. - Guy Caskey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Making Him L.O.R.D. is a book about allowing God to control your life in such a way that there are incredible results. &amp;ldquo;You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit with you was not without results.&amp;rdquo; 1 Thessalonians 2:1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible refers to results as Christ expressing His life in and through you. Some may refer to this as fruit, work, multiplication or movement. All of those are appropriate ways to describe how God wants to cover the earth with His Glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, we want to be honest with the admission that this cannot be done on our own, but can only be done by Christ&amp;rsquo;s power! A life surrendered to God is a vessel used by God to accomplish His vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.O.R.D. is an acrostic that stands for living out Reproducible Discipleship. If you want your life to echo throughout the halls of eternity, this is a book for you. Our Master and King has set forth the plan, and people of purpose are His chosen instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is about a captivating vision held by many Kingdom-minded citizens who desire that none shall perish. This is the Father&amp;rsquo;s heart!&lt;/p&gt;" />
