The Tree of Knowledge
When examining the myths and folklore of the ancient Vikings and earlier Norse Tribes of Scandinavia,
we find a recurring Legend passed on as fact. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before the beginning of time when the Spirit was upon the earth for all to know and see, the first man
grew from a sweat gland upon the Sap of the Tree of ASK. The tree, ASK released Spiritual spores,
the invisible zygote manifested form in the physical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The cells within became fecund, activated in life, triggered by Spirit, built into an ovum or egg attached
to the root of the Great Tree, which bore the primitive, ancestral hermaphrodite of the human race.
In ancient times numerous gods were upon the earth and in the inner lands of Spiritual and
Astral realms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following Natures Involution &amp; Evolution trajectory, came the Devolution of the Races of Man, the gradual
descent to the remainder of today. The legend tells of how the gods ceased to argue and came together
in mind and Spirit, projected their consciousness to the Tree known as ASK, The Knower of all to be
Known and created from the Tree, ASK, the ancestor of man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each culture in History, with the exception of the current modern groups, has produced a Tree of Knowledge
sacred to the peoples. In a world lost in materiality humanity clear-fell the carriers of Knowledge.
The Tree, a Spiritual source, a point of refuge; without her leafy arbour there is no human life. Hug a
tree and draw upon her strength, tune to her wisdom, wonder at her androgynous nature, hear the words
whispered in the winds upon her leaf and in her breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In China, the Sung-Ming-Shu, is the ancestral Chinese Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of
Spiritual Life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Pippala Tree is the occult Fig Tree of Knowledge from the Sanskrit language of pre India.
In Vanuatu of the Pacific Islands the Nutapika Nut Tree is the main source of protein, however it is the
Banyan Tree which is the giver of Spiritual Wisdom and holds the Sacred stones.
In Tibet the Sacred Tree of Knowledge is still known as the Tree of Life  Zampun. Malaysia has the
Spiritual blossoms of the ever flowering Tree of Wisdom, the Angsana Tree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ASK The Tree of Knowledge &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the Qoran (Koran) the Scriptures speak of the Ababel, the Tree of Mystery the Tree of Knowledge.
Asvattha, the giant fig tree of ancient India, symbolic of the Supreme Spirit the ever-lasting refuge, the
Tree of All Knowing, rooted in Heaven and in earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each leaf is a Song of Revelation, a Veda. To have supreme knowledge is to know the song within
each and every leaf, the fruit of Asvattha gives eternal Spiritual Life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ASK, the eternal rootless tree of Timelessness rooted in Spiritual Ground self-generating Mother Nature,
the Spiritual Source, the anchor from which the Phoenix of Spiritual Immortality ascends.
ASK is the name of the Scandinavian Ash tree, known throughout time as the Tree of
Knowledge. Ask, ASK and you shall be answered herein. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
