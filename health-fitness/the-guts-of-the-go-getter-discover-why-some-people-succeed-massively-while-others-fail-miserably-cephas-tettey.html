  <title>THE GUTS OF THE GO-GETTER: Discover Why Some People Succeed Massively While Others Fail Miserably - Cephas Tettey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cephas has been practising the techniques contained in the THE GUTS OF THE GO-GETTER since elementary school. This principles enabled him to earn multiple degrees from around the world&amp;mdash;Master of Science in Infrastructure Planning from Germany, Advanced Diploma in Project Management from Britain and Bachelor of Science in Planning from Ghana. Also, these techniques helped him travel around the world. In the past ten years alone, he lived in three countries (US, Germany and Ghana). Isn&amp;rsquo;t it intriguing to know each belong to a different continent? And this does not include the database for his vacation trips to places like Russia.People who do not know his humble beginning often commend his go-getter personality. But his experiences were a sharp contradiction to what he has achieved. During his last years in elementary school, his dad was transferred to a remote community as the headmaster. Unfortunately for him, he was enrolled in a different school. He became a victim of little pranks. As the years went by, he emerged as the best student in his elementary school. He, therefore, thought he would be nominated for the school prefect (or senior prefect) position. He was bypassed for that position and instead honored with the assistant senior prefect position. He was heartbroken. When the matter came to the attention of his dad, he went to the school to confront the authorities. His dad was told that though his son was an excellent pupil, he was too weak to handle the school prefect position. His daddy then instilled in him that he could get anything he wanted, control any circumstance, or break any tough opponent despite his baby looks. That was the turning point in his life. He discovered that life is &amp;nbsp;fun and&amp;nbsp; interesting if people can mingle freely with whoever or whatever they choose to be with, go wherever they choose to go, do whatever they choose to do, have whatever they choose to have and be whoever they choose to be. There shall always be barriers to this kind of life, but inside this book are the principles to breaking these barriers and living on your terms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
