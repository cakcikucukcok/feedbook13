  <title>Love Letters from Jesus - Sally F Boenau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you feel hopeless, unloved, and defeated?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victory in Jesus is your inheritance! Be encouraged and affirmed!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Letters from Jesus will flood your heart with Gods love, imparting hope, joy, peace, and victory for you as you walk with Him. They were inspired by the words and life of Jesus and 1 Corinthians 13the love chapter of the epistles. There are countless testimonies of thanks for the inspiration and encouragement these letters have provided.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the love and truth of each letter bless your heart and those around you!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I received a letter from this book before it even got published, and it touched my heart deep down where my tears puddle. This is an amazing collection of thoughts straight from Gods heart. Ms Boenaus very personal relationship with the Lord is evident in each page. A book for everyone on your list.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Barbara&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Love Letters from Jesus is a joy to read. I find comfort in every word. I would highly recommend this book.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary,p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Letters from Jesus is a precious book relaying the unconditional Fathers love for us based on all scripture. The truths in this book are needed to keep our minds free from fears and our hearts focused on heaven. This book is written for our present times.&lt;p&gt;
