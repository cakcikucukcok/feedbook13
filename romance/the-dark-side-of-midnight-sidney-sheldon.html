  <title>The Dark Side of Midnight - Sidney Sheldon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now appearing for the first time together, three of Sidney Sheldon&#39;s number one bestselling novels&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;The Other Side of Midnight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rage of Angels&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bloodline&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;are featured in this celebratory collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Other Side of Midnight&lt;/em&gt; is Sidney Sheldon at his best. This page-turner is full of tortured romantic entanglements, reverses of fortune, thrilling suspense, and ultimate justice. In Paris, Washington, and a fabulous villa in Greece, an innocent American becomes a bewildered, horror-stricken pawn in a game of vengeance and betrayal. She is Catherine Douglas, a woman caught in a web of four lives intertwined by passion as her handsome husband pursues an incredibly beautiful film star . . . and as Constantin Demeris, a legendary Greek tycoon, tightens the strands that control them all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rage of Angels&lt;/em&gt; features the memorable, mesmerizing heroine Jennifer Parker, a razor-sharp but beautiful attorney on her way up the New York political ladder until the Mafia&#39;s schemes win her the hatred of an implacable enemy&amp;#8212;and a love more destructive than hate. She journeys into the dangerous, dramatic, and dark world of organized crime and flashbulb-lit courtrooms, where ambitious and ruthless prosecutors begin their climb to power, and she travels to her own personal hell and back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodline&lt;/em&gt; is one of the best of Sheldon&#39;s blockbuster thrillers. Roffe and Sons is a family firm, an international empire filled with desperate, cash-hungry family members. At its head was one of the wealthiest men in the world&amp;#8212;a man who has just died in a mysterious accident and left his daughter, Elizabeth, in control of the company. Now as this intelligent, tough, and gorgeous woman dares to save&amp;#8212;not sell&amp;#8212;Roffe and Sons, she will have to outwit those who secretly want her power . . . and the unknown assassin who wants her life. &lt;em&gt;Bloodline&lt;/em&gt; is a sweeping novel of high financial intrigue on three continents, love, murder, danger, and suspense. &lt;/p&gt;" />
