          &lt;strong&gt;TEXAS BRIDES HIS WOMAN, HIS CHILD&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jesse Barrister was back - lean muscled, broad shouldered and fit to be tied. Seemed his former sweetheart Mandy McCloud had a child who was the rancher&#39;s spittin&#39; image. Could the boy be a Barrister? And if so, would the long-ragin&#39; feud between the Barristers and the McClouds finally come to an end? Jesse wasn&#39;t looking to make amends - all he wanted was to claim his son… and another night in Mandy&#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But sharing a child with Mandy was a whole lot different from sharing a bed with her. And soon the hard-hearted cowboy had a hankering to wake up next to Mandy, morning after morning after morning… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TEXAS BRIDES: &lt;em&gt;Come on down to the McCloud family ranch - &#39;cause there&#39;s no place like Texas for a wedding!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
