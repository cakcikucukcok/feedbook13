  <title>The Art of the Authoress of Anastasia: the Autobiography of H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna of Russia - J (Johannes) Froebel-Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1963 a woman by the name of &quot;Evgenia Smetisko,&quot; an immigrant who purportedly entered the United States from Roumania according to her 1928 naturalization papers, published &quot;Anastasia: The Autobiography of HIH The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna of Russia.&quot; When asked if she were indeed the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra, she denied it and failed a lie detector test. Upon acknowledging the fact, she passed. Although her immigration and naturalization papers state that &quot;Evgenia&quot; was born on January 25, 1899, her grave cross in the cemetery of Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Monastery in Jordanville, New York lists the birthdate as June 18, 1901. On that date Grand Duchess Anastasia was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. Both Anastasia and &quot;Evgenia&quot; were artistically inclined. Paintings and embroidery from &quot;Evgenia&#39;s&quot; collection, which were NOT deemed suitable for inclusion in the monastery&#39;s Russian history museum and now reside in a private collection, are offered here for the enjoyment of the reader." />
