  <title>It Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Crazy at Work - Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this timely manifesto, the authors of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Rework &lt;/em&gt;broadly reject the prevailing notion that long hours, aggressive hustle, and &quot;whatever it takes&quot; are required to run a successful business today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rework&lt;/em&gt;, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson introduced a new path to working effectively. Now, they build on their message with a bold, iconoclastic strategy for creating the ideal company culture&amp;#8212;what they call &quot;the calm company.&quot; Their approach directly attack the chaos, anxiety, and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and hampers billions of workers every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long hours, an excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for modern professionals. But it should be a mark of stupidity, the authors argue. Sadly, this isn&amp;#8217;t just a problem for large organizations&amp;#8212;individuals, contractors, and solopreneurs are burning themselves out the same way. The answer to better productivity isn&amp;#8217;t more hours&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction and persistent stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time to stop celebrating Crazy, and start celebrating Calm, Fried and Hansson assert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. &quot;Calm&quot; has been the cornerstone of their company&amp;#8217;s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, &lt;em&gt;It Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/em&gt; is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn&amp;#8217;t a book telling you what to do. It&amp;#8217;s a book showing you what they&amp;#8217;ve done&amp;#8212;and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
