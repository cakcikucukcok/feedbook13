  <title>Madonna - Andrew Morton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The explosive &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller-- &lt;i&gt;Madonna&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From motherless child to wife and mother, from &quot;boy toy&quot; to fiercely independent diva, Madonna is one of the most remarkable women of our time. With a career that spans decades and ranges from the scandalous to the transcendent, she is a bigger phenomenon than ever. But who is the private woman behind the public image?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Morton, whose #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers about Princess Diana and Monica Lewinsky have proven his ability to gain access to insiders who won&#39;t talk to anyone else, answers that question in this decidedly unauthorized new biography. Morton&#39;s extensive, in-depth interviews with members of Madonna&#39;s inner circle-- lovers, friends, and business connection, many of whom have never spoken out before-- allow him to go beyond the carefully constructed myths to unmask the real Madonna. Andrew Morton is able to make startling revelations, among them the real story of Madonna&#39;s family background; the events behind the violent attack that changed her views on sex and men; her relationships with Michael Jackson, Prince, John F. Kennedy Jr., Vanilla Ice, and other rock and Hollywood stars; the mystery man she wanted to marry; and the darkest days of her career when she threatened to quit show business. In this fascinating, richly detailed biography, Andrew Morton reveals Madonna in an entirely new light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 16 pages of photographs&lt;/p&gt;" />
