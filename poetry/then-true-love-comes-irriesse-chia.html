  <title>Then True Love Comes - Irriesse Chia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This life is 
a self-experiment. 
Isnt it?
&lt;p&gt;Trial and error. 
&lt;p&gt;But normally trial and error is preceded by deciding on objectives or outcomes that we can expect. What is the end in mind? Is having an ending important? Or is life just a hit and run?
&lt;p&gt;Each one of us is in this world from inside a human body. We are observing, experiencing, thinking, and feeling. We can feel angry or unaffected, tearful or light-hearted, hopeless or euphoric. These feelings are to be acknowledged, as they are signs from someone.
&lt;p&gt;Then True Love Comes is Irriesse Chias journey of realization and transformation, soulfully expressed through poems written through trial and error over twenty years. She bares her spiritual nakedness as she reveals her lookout, amidst the fusses of daily life, for a mysterious God that dumped her on earth. 
&lt;p&gt;Then True Love Comes challenges youif you were the hero in your own adventure movie, how would that movie end? Is it possible to summon the kind of ending that you want, like a fairy-tale romance where true love comes in the end?
&lt;p&gt;As Chia has discovered through her own trial and error, these poems will inspire you to notice and reveal these findings in your own life:
	The desires that have been planted in you will keep on calling you. You are worthy of it because you were made for it.
	You can sieve through the daily motions of life to discover, accept, and follow your bliss. Then persist to trust and have faith in your journey instead of focusing on fear. 
	When you live in the end, you will awaken to your own power; so let your true love come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
