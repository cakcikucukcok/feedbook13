      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Zo&amp;#235; Heller&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Notes on a Scandal&lt;/em&gt; and Tom Perrotta&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Fletcher,&lt;/em&gt; an explosive and thought-provoking novel about the far-reaching repercussions of an illicit relationship between a young girl and a man twenty years her senior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rising star in the London arts scene of the early 1970s, gifted composer Ralph Boyd is approached by renowned novelist Edmund Greenslay to score a stage adaptation of his most famous work. Welcomed into Greenslay&amp;#8217;s sprawling bohemian house in Putney, an artistic and prosperous district in southwest London, the musical wunderkind is introduced to Edmund&amp;#8217;s beautiful activist wife Ellie, his aloof son Theo, and his nine-year old daughter Daphne, who quickly becomes Ralph&amp;#8217;s muse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph showers Daphne with tokens of his affection&amp;#8212;clandestine gifts and secret notes. In a home that is exciting but often lonely, Daphne finds Ralph to be a dazzling companion. Their bond remains strong even after Ralph becomes a husband and father, and though Ralph worships Daphne, he does not touch her. But in the summer of 1976, when Ralph accompanies thirteen-year-old Daphne alone to meet her parents in Greece, their relationship intensifies irrevocably. One person knows of their passionate trysts: Daphne&amp;#8217;s best friend Jane, whose awe of the intoxicating Greenslay family ensures her silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty years later Daphne is back in London. After years lost to decadence and drug abuse, she is struggling to create a normal, stable life for herself and her adolescent daughter. When circumstances bring her back in touch with her long-lost friend, Jane, their reunion inevitably turns to Ralph, now a world-famous musician also living in the city. Daphne&amp;#8217;s recollections of her childhood and her growing anxiety over her own young daughter eventually lead to an explosive realization that propels her to confront Ralph and their years spent together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masterfully told from three diverse viewpoints&amp;#8212;victim, perpetrator, and witness&amp;#8212;Putney is a subtle and enormously powerful novel about consent, agency, and what we tell ourselves to justify what we do, and what others do to us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
