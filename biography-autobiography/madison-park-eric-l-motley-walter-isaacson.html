  <title>Madison Park - Eric L.  Motley, Walter Isaacson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Madison Park, a small community in Alabama founded by freed slaves in 1880. And meet Eric Motley, a native son who came of age in this remarkable place where constant lessons in self-determination, hope, and unceasing belief in the American dream taught him everything he needed for his journey to the Oval Office as a Special Assistant to President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric grew up among people whose belief was to &amp;ldquo;give&amp;rdquo; and never turn away from your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s need.&amp;nbsp;There was Aunt Shine, the goodly matriarch who cared so much about young Motley&amp;rsquo;s schooling that she would stand up in a crowded church and announce Eric&amp;rsquo;s progress or his shortcomings. There was Old Man Salery, who secretly siphoned gasoline from his beat-up car into the Motley&amp;rsquo;s tank at night.&amp;nbsp;There were Motley&amp;rsquo;s grandparents, who bought books for Eric they couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford, spending the last of their seed money. And there was Reverend Brinkley, a man of enormous faith and simple living. It was said that whenever the Reverend came your way, light abounded. Life in Madison Park wasn&amp;rsquo;t always easy or fair,&amp;nbsp;and Motley reveals personal and heartbreaking stories of racial injustice and segregation. But Eric shows how the community taught him everything he needed to know about love and faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This charming, engaging, and deeply inspiring memoir will help you remember that we can create a world of shared values based on love and hope. It is a story that reveals the amazing power of faith in God and each other. If you&amp;rsquo;re in search of hope during troubled times, look no further than Madison Park.&lt;/p&gt;" />
