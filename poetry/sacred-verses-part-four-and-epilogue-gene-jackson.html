  <title>Sacred Verses,  Part Four and Epilogue - Gene Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth and concluding volume of the quartet of &lt;i&gt;SACRED VERSES&lt;/i&gt;. The entire work is an approximate modern adaptation of Dante&#39;s &lt;i&gt;DIVINE COMEDY&lt;/i&gt;. In the PROLOGUE, a young man suffers a great loss in his life, and in addition, the loss of innocence and certitude that are characteristic of youth. This leads him to seek the meaning of the world and of his life. In Parts I, II, and III he explores the physical world, the philosophy or human thought throughout the centuries (the universe of ideas), and finally the spiritual meaning of life, as revealed by many scientists, philosophers and prophets. In each of these endeavors, he has a mentor (for Dante these were Virgil and Beatrice). In this, the final quest, it is Mother Teresa, who has said, &quot;In the End, we all are One.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these journeys, the young man ages and matures as he seeks (and eventually finds) a resolution of his quest. At the beginning and at the end of his search, he is counseled by the great Greek playwright, Sophocles. Eventually in the Epilogue, he is reunited with his loss and achieves a final resolution of his search and his journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
