  <title>Agent Angus - K.L. Denman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Angus and his best buddy, Shahid, share a love of science and their robot, Gordon. But recently, the artistic Ella Eckles has had a peculiar effect on Angus. When a stink bomb at the school provides a chance for him to talk to her, he claims to share her interest in reading facial expressions and declares his ambition to become a crime-solving mentalist. He impresses Ella by identifying the stink bomber, but fails to mention he witnessed a scrawny kid setting off the bomb. When Ella&#39;s treasured sketchbook is stolen, she asks Angus to find the thief. Shahid thinks Angus should confess that he&#39;s not a mentalist, but Angus is certain he can learn to read people and recover Ella&#39;s sketchbook. He asks Shahid to help him investigate the suspects: Gaga Girl; the art teacher, Mr. Wilder; and finally, &quot;scrawny kid.&quot; Equipped with rearview sunglasses and an informant who lurks in the washroom, the duo bungles their way through a series of encounters that alarm Shahid and provide Angus with some unfamiliar exercise." />
