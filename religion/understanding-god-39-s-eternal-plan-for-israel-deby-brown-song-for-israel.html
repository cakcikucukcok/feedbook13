  <title>Understanding God&#39;s Eternal Plan for Israel - Deby Brown, Song for Israel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no other nation in history that has experienced what Israel has. Throughout history, people and nations have tried to destroy the Jewish people. With anti-Semitism on the rise once more and enemies threatening to wipe Israel from the face of the earth, many Christians want to instead show their love for Israel and the Jewish people. However, most Christians have no idea how to show support for or defend the Jewish people. Understanding God&#39;s Eternal Plan for Israel provides an overview of Israel&#39;s spiritual, historical, and political history, challenging believers in Christ to bless Israel and its people. Christian believers can learn about the biblical holy days (or feasts), how God called Israel to be a chosen nation to accomplish his work, and how the Middle Eastern conflict began and why it matters for both the Jewish people and Christians today. If Christians can understand God&#39;s plan for Israel, then we can be in alignment with the Word of God." />
