  <title>Two Leaves and a Bud - Yvonne Tomlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early 1940s, a young Anglo Indian mother is abandoned by her husband and left with their six children all under the age of ten. Without financial support, her heart is broken when she is forced to give up her children who were placed into Dr. Grahams Homes, a group home in Northern India, staffed by British Missionaries. The author who was the fourth child and only girl among the six children tells a compelling and candid account of her childhood within a restricted and sheltered environment. A story enfolds of the struggle to find her identity where she finally embraces both her Indian and British roots, and her passion to reunite with her mother comes through with emotion and poignancy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
