  <title>Parables in the Noble Qur&#39;an - Idp Research Division</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Several parables and examples have been utilized in the Qur&amp;#39;an which cannot be comprehended except by those who have knowledge. These examples have been expressed by drawing similarities between one thing and another in relation to the ruling, and by closing the gaps between abstracted mental ideas and tangible objects by means of an example that can be perceived by the senses, or a sensory example by means of another - so that the first one may be regarded in terms of the second.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of Verses in the Qur&amp;#39;an by which Allah, the Most High, brings greater clarity and insight when explaining things to mankind. This is done through the use of deep and meaningful parables (amthal) that are clear for the human intellect to comprehend and ponder over in order to understand the message fully. It is from His infinite Wisdom that Allah Destined these parables to become rooted in His Final Revelation until the Last Day - through which mankind can increase in knowledge and recognise guidance and embrace the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In discussing the unique style, theme and content of the Qur&amp;#39;an, there is little by way of English literature that identifies and explains the invaluable parables found therein. The depth of this work will stimulate the intellect to ponder over the beauty of the articulated literary style and precision of the Magnificent Qur&amp;#39;an, guiding mankind to the straight path. This publication is intended as an introduction to some of the reasons and wisdoms and beauty of a select few, which Allah uses for deliberate and poignant purpose. Not only is this work an intellectual discourse, it also provides inspiration and instils spiritual enlightenment for every Muslim who seeks to create a stronger bond with the Mighty Book of Allah.&lt;br /&gt;
