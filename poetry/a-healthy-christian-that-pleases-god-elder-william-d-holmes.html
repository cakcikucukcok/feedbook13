  <title>A Healthy Christian That Pleases God - Elder William D. Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, author Elder William D. Holmes gives an account of life of the church, how strong Christians used to be, and how that people live for God with all their hearts, soul, and mind. They conducted themselves as people of God in the way they dressed and live holy free from sin among the sinners. They fasted, prayed, and testified and were saved, sanctified, baptized, and filled with the Holy Ghost and fire. The power of God was present in the church that it would knock and roll people on the floor! They may not have money in their pockets or any of these worldly goods, but they had Jesus in their souls on their way to heaven. They may not have nice pews or carpet on the floor, and some did not have much education, but they had the power of God in their lives. We are going to take a look at the church today, how that we have better churches with modern technology. We are more educated and have more money, but what happened to the power of God from the old church? Christians today cannot testify living free from sin. Some cannot shout and praise God until they get all sweaty! Pride has taken over the church today. Christians have become spiritually sick! There are so many teachings, doctrines, and cults to confuse people. Satan has taken a seat in the church. In the midst of all of these, a Christian today can be healthy. We are going to take a look at how a person can live a life to please God today in our generation, just like the saints of old. Most of all, well look at how to make heaven your home." />
