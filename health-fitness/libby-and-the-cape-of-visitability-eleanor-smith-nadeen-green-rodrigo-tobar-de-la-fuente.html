  <title>Libby and the Cape of Visitability - Eleanor Smith, Nadeen Green, Rodrigo Tobar De la Fuente</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Libby, Aria and Benjamin have been best friends since they were babies.   But now Aria has moved to a new house and Libby, who uses a wheelchair, doesnt get invited to Arias birthday party because the house has barriers.   Hurt feelings followThen the kids meet Everett, an adult wheelchair athlete, who tells them how the disability rights movement gained successes through years of public demonstrations and pressing for laws.  Everett shows them a picture from the 70s showing people with disabilities blocking inaccessible buses.     The kids are inspired to their version of public action to achieve the goal that every new house would have a step-free entrance and wide bathroom doors.   Learn how the kids get on the front page of their hometown paper, as their method gets them in trouble  and how they achieve a sweet victory.    
&quot;Libby and the Cape of Visitability&quot; is the diary of Libby, a KWD (Kid with Disability).  Written for children ages 8-13, this book raises awareness of the exclusion created when houses are not built with simple features that allow wheelchair users to visit or live in them.  For those grownups (teachers, parents and others) who engage in meaningful dialogue with children, this book provides not only a captivating story and relatable characters, but a Reader&#39;s Guide with discussion questions and resources as well.
Eleanor Smith is a well known civil rights worker and Nadeen Green is a teacher, writer and blogger on the topic of fair housing." />
