  <title>“Death” by the Potter’S Wheel - Conrad M. Follmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is more important than knowing that we are ALL infinite spiritual beings on a human journey to this earthly classroom, rather than being sinful humans on a journey in search of redemption and salvation? Understanding this marked distinction permits us to learn who we truly are at our core, to uncover the nature of our Sacred Journey, and to know without doubt how completely and equally Loved we all are. These tenets are at the heart of this inspiring true story about Jennie, a housewife and mother from the Philadelphia area, who was shaped as a mystical channel by The Great Potter, He Who shapes us all.
Spanning almost a half-century, beginning on November 11, 1966, over 1,000 Messages and Lessons were channeled through Jen from Angels, Masters, Lords, and other Sublime sources. In addition, her unique visions and dreams, healings, and psychic and past life readings, were other special Gifts bestowed upon her. This book bears testimony to Jens uncommon life and works, as attested to by the author, who is Jens nephew, godson, and soulmate.
Share in Jens amazing spiritual journey, molded as it was by the hands of The Great Potter. More importantly, learn how YOU, as a Seeker, are also being shaped, along the path of your personal Sacred Journey" />
