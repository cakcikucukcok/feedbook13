  <title>Lion Cross Point - Masatsugu Ono, Angus Turvill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A &quot;Book You Should Read This April&quot; at &lt;i&gt;Literary Hub&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the winner of the Akutagawa Prize, Japan&#39;s most prestigious literary award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does a shy, traumatized boy overcome the shame, anger, and sadness that silence him? In &lt;em&gt;Lion Cross Point&lt;/em&gt;, celebrated Japanese author Masatsugu Ono turns his gentle pen to the mind of ten-year-old Takeru, who arrives at his family&amp;rsquo;s home village amid a scorching summer, carrying memories of unspeakable acts against his mother and brother. As Takeru befriends Mitsuko, his new caretaker, and Saki, his spunky neighbor, he meets more of his mother&amp;rsquo;s old friends, discovering her history and inching toward a new idea of family and home. All the while he begins to see a strange figure called Bunji&amp;mdash;the same name as a delicate young boy who mysteriously vanished long ago on the village&amp;rsquo;s breathtaking coastline at Lion Cross Point. At once a subtle portrayal of a child&amp;rsquo;s sense of memory and community, an empowering exploration of how we find the words to encompass our trauma, and a spooky Japanese ghost story, &lt;em&gt;Lion Cross Point&lt;/em&gt; is gripping and poignant, reminiscent of Kenzabur? ?e&amp;rsquo;s best work. Acts of heartless brutality mix with surprising moments of pure kindness, creating this utterly truthful, cathartic tale of an unforgettable young boy." />
