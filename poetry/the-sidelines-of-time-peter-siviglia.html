  <title>The Sidelines of Time - Peter Siviglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter Siviglia is a successful lawyer, possibly leaving readers wondering how he could be good at writing poetry. Well, during a career spanning more than half a century, he became an expert at observation, and through his observations of people and every-day life, he has produced a collection that sees through the veil of things we hide, penetrating the heart of humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sidelines of Time has three parts: Poetry, Recipes from the Top of the Food Chain, and Poetic Justice. Part I touches upon those questions that haunt each of us. Siviglia has the unique ability, without fear or pretense, to say a great deal using few words, stunning imagery, sound, and engaging observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II comprises learning gleaned during that career of more than fifty years. Artfully honed aphorisms, hailed by James Geary, a best-selling author on the subject, teach what is most important in life and in work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part III, the author becomes a player in a rough, darkly humorous exchange with a banker, jousting in the midst of a failed construction project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this lawyer have to offer us? Plenty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
