  <title>Mama &#39;N&#39; &#39;Em - Louis Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In writing these story&#39;s, I confess my older siblings inspired and convinced me the need for them to be told. The stories are centered, on the life of an extended family revealing the past as it was lived. Their past lives yet undocumented who became freedmen and formed an early base for progress towards a free society of blacks. This family spoke glowingly of their past. They surrendered themselves to the cause in World War One. They gained some resemblance of advancing freedom but more economic advancement in the Roaring twenties that followed. Progress was a struggle. World War Two brought a necessity for all people to be involved. We, Mama N &#39;Em&#39;s continued to struggle for progress, affected by economic conditions, the prejudices of our governing bodies, schooling opportunities or the lack there of, our race conscious leaders and ministers as well as those who opposed our progress. Here are stories of one family who endured those experiences. As the author I have attempted to relate as much of the life and times as possible and being the sixth child of a larger family the stories become more biological yet the lifetime of Mama N &#39;Em is kept." />
