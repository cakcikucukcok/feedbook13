  <title>Further Chronicles of Avonlea - Lucy M. Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucy Maud Montgomery is best known for her &quot;Anne&quot; series, starting with &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. A lifelong writer, Montgomery wrote her first poem at nine years old. Many of her stories, and the characters within them, were written from an autobiographical stance. &quot;Further Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;, published in 1920, is a sequel to her &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;. This sequel created a great deal of controversy as it was published without the consent of the author, and led to a nine-year-long legal battle between Montgomery and her publishers, L. C. Page &amp; Co., from which Montgomery won $18,000. This collection includes: &quot;Aunt Cynthia&#39;s Persian Cat,&quot; &quot;The Materializing of Cecil,&quot; &quot;Her Father&#39;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;Jane&#39;s Baby,&quot; &quot;The Dream-Child,&quot; &quot;The Brother Who Failed,&quot; &quot;The Return of Hester,&quot; &quot;The Little Brown Book of Miss Emily,&quot; &quot;Sara&#39;s Way,&quot; &quot;The Son of his Mother,&quot; &quot;The Education of Betty,&quot; &quot;In Her Selfless Mood,&quot; &quot;The Conscience Case of David Bell,&quot; &quot;Only a Common Fellow,&quot; and &quot;Tannis of the Flats.&quot;" />
