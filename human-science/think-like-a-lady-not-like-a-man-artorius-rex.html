  <title>Think Like a Lady, Not Like a Man - Artorius Rex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RIDICULE (relationships, intimacy, deception, immorality, commitment, ugliness, love exposed).
Women are ridiculed by men. Men subject women to contemptuous and dismissive language and behavior. Men treat women as if they were unworthy of any true acts of kindness, honor, or respect. Men rob women of their godly spiritual significance on earth. Men have been able to do these things because they have deceitfully made women feel esteemed for exploiting their body, and they have used money to ensure women accept degradation with a smile. 
Women have thus fallen in love with money, and they covet the material things money can buy. Now women partake in the unfruitful works of darkness instead of exposing them (Eph. 5:11). Women no longer adorn themselves in respectable apparel or dress modestly. They fashion themselves in fancy hairstyles and adorn themselves in expensive jewelry and costly attire (1 Tim. 2:9). Simply put, women dress seductively.
The attention women receive from dressing seductively fascinates them. However, their bewitchment brings attention to themselves in the wrong way. Therefore, men do not view them in the purest of ways or intent. Appearance limits women to focusing on who they are from a worldview instead of who they are in Christ. The error allows men to lead women down a path of prostitution, whoredom, wickedness, and abuse! Think Like a Lady, Not Like a Man spiritually and secularly exposes what men have done to women in a world system that ignores God." />
