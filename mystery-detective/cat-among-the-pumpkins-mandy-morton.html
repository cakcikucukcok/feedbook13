      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cat lovers, rejoice! The second installment in Mandy Morton&#39;s cat-driven series has arrived with &lt;i&gt;Cat Among the Pumpkins&lt;/i&gt;, where crime-solving is in the capable paws of felines. And these cats haven&#39;t been declawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As All Hallows&#39; Eve approaches, Hettie  Bagshot of The No. 2 Feline Detective Agency has more than just a ghost  and warlock tart on her plate. Along with her faithful sidekick, Tilly,  the tabby duo set out to investigate an old crime and a spate of new  murders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is Mavis Spitforce dressed as a pumpkin? Can Irene  Peggledrip really talk to cats from the spirit world? Did Milky Myers  murder his family on Halloween, longer ago than anyone can remember? All  questions the pair must answer before the case can be solved. As the  November fog closes in, where will the killer strike next--and will  there be enough catnip to go around?&lt;/p&gt;" />
