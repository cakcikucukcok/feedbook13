        &lt;p&gt;Diego Laremos had never forgotten the last night he&#39;d spent with Melissa Sterling five years before. She&#39;d fled their home after a bitter dispute, hoping to escape their unhappy marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He hadn&#39;t forgiven her for leaving, though he&#39;d hated himself even more for driving her away. Seeing Melissa again had renewed his hope for a possible future together…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melissa had felt the same way, but she&#39;d lied to Diego in the past. Now she had to prove to him that she was indeed his love–his &lt;em&gt;ENAMORADA&lt;/em&gt;–and that the truth could set them both free…to love again.&lt;/p&gt;
