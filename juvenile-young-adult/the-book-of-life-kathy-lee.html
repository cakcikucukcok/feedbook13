  <title>The Book of Life - Kathy Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="‘It was a blind man who brought the fateful message to the king. And I helped him. Afterwards, I thought it was the worst mistake of my life.
You can’t go back and change the past. Later you look back and think, if only… If only he’d never made it as far as Embra… or if I’d walked right past him… or if the
guards had turned him away at the castle gate…’
A blind beggar from the south brings a mysterious message to the King of Lothian. An old friend needs your help… But the message is the start of a dangerous mission, taking Rob and Jamie far from Embra to a land of darkness, slavery and death. Will they ever be able to escape? And can they still trust in God, even when he seems far away? 
This is the last in the popular Lost Book Trilogy, a series of Christian futuristic fantasy fiction for children aged 8 to 11. Although a fantastic adventure story in its own right, it will also help children to rely on God in the tough times." />
