  <title>Good Morning, Who! - Alberta L. O’Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to author Alberta OBrien, alcoholism and addiction are greatly glamorized by media and worn like a badge of honor by the offendersthe celebrities, the glitterati, the role models of todays kids. However, alcoholics and addicts, in general, have very different lives than those portrayed in the news. OBriens Good Morning, Who! exposes the typical rather than star-studded side to the newsmakers story, without the glitz or glamour. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In sharing her personal struggle, OBrien gives readers the real deal to being alcoholic or addicted: the legal and financial problems; the shame, isolation, remorse; and the moral and spiritual bankruptcy they eventually experience. She candidly describes her odyssey through the stages of alcoholism and her arduous struggle for sobriety. Once she finally gets into recovery, she is left with the ism that made her drink in the first place. Confronting her demons, she realizes lifes solutions do not come from a hit of dope or days of inebriation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you do have a problem with alcohol or drugs, there is a solution. And, OBrien adds, If I can get sober, you can too.  She offers her compelling message to readers who see no light at the end of the tunnel." />
