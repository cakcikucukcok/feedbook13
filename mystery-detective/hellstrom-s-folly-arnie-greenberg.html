  <title>Hellstrom’S Folly - Arnie Greenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There was nothing simple about Bruce Kellner. He wasnt an artist, but he was a man of paintingsan art sleuth and a finder of missing treasures. Having just closed the file on a stolen Picasso art caper that had taken him to France, England, Mexico, and the Sabine Hills of Italy at Rocca Sinibalda, he is celebrating with an evening out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While enjoying an aged Chateuneuf du pape at a restaurant in Nice, Kellner is approached by Comtesse Marie-Claude de Hautefort, a French countess who wishes to hire him to locate a missing work of art. Its a drawing said to have been penned by Leonardo da Vinci in the late fifteenth-century and now its missing from the countesss thirteenth-century chateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, Kellner takes on the case and interviews friends, family, and police about the robbery during a tour that takes him to some of Europes greatest treasures. Though Kellner has always been most successful at his job, this case leads him to more than he bargained fora discovery he couldnt have imagined in his wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
