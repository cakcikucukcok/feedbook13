  <title>STORIES FROM THE ARABIAN NIGHTS - lavishly illustrated children&#39;s tales - Anon E. Mouse, Retold By Laurence Housman, Illustrated by Edmund Dulac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this volume, Laurence Housman, retells 6 of the most popular tales from 1001 Arabian Nights. While there are only 6 tales in this volume, they are brought to life with 50 lavishly illustrated images by the famous illustrator Edmund Dulac. The six tales are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Fisherman And The Genie&lt;br /&gt;
The Story Of The King Of The Ebony Isles&lt;br /&gt;
Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves&lt;br /&gt;
The Story Of The Magic Horse&lt;br /&gt;
The Story Of The Wicked Half-Brothers&lt;br /&gt;
The Story Of The Princess Of Deryabar&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All these tales are narrated by Scheherazad&amp;egrave;, the heroine of the Thousand and one Nights. She ranks among the great story-tellers of the world and gives a distinctly Arabian flavour and feel to the stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In all these tales something magical and wonderful occurs. Sometimes it is a talking donkey, an evil witch or a corrupt Vizier. Whenever evil raises its head, a hero sallies forth to save the day. As per usual evil is vanquished and the hero and his princess ride off into the sunset. While the plot is always the familiar, the characters and the setting are not making the stories all the more interesting and captivating for young minds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: The Princess of Deryabar featured in &amp;ldquo;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&amp;rdquo; (1958). The role was played by Kathryn Grant while Sinbad was played by Kerwin Matthews. It is believed that this volume and other illustrations by Dulac were directly responsible for the making of the film.&lt;br /&gt;
