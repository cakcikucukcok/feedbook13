  <title>Just One Little Seed - Annette Peterson, Joseph Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was borne out of the heart of a dad grieving the deep loss of his oldest daughter. Diagnosed with cancer at just 8 years old, God welcomed a unique and vibrant 9 year old, Malia Grace, into heaven on December 7, 2010. In the many months that followed Joseph found expression of his hurt, renewing of his faith, and peace in the process by putting his pain to paper. His simplistic and free flowing poetic style reveals glimpses of the profound truths he encountered on this life journey. As you explore the pages that follow, I believe you will discover a story offering hope for the hopeless, joy found in the midst of pain, and peace for times of chaos. Ultimately, it is the story of Gods great love for each of us, and his rescuing of us from the deep places of darkness life often holds. We pray your own soul finds ultimate healing as you read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
