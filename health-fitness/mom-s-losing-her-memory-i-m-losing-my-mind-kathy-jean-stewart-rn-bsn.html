  <title>Mom’S Losing Her Memory I’M Losing My Mind! - Kathy Jean Stewart Rn Bsn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The subject of physical and mental deterioration and its consequences on people and their loved ones is one that most of us prefer to avoid, even those of us who provide medical care to the elderly. Yet, this is often part of the human experience. Information written on the subject is usually dry and didactic. Kathy Stewart has granted the reader access to her world, the assisted living community, where extraordinary needs are met by extraordinary people. Through interesting, illustrative, and poignant vignettes, a realistic, often intense and yet hopeful experience is accorded the reader. This book, crafted professionally and compassionately, is a gem that should be read not only by relatives of people suffering progressive memory loss but by all of us, since many of us will eventually be touched by this situation in our lifetimes.&lt;br&gt;
Mark H. Greenberg, MD, FACR, Rheumatologist, Author of Doctor, Why Do I Hurt So Much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few events impact an entire family more than the onset of dementia in a parent, spouse, sibling, or close friend. Drawing upon her own personal and professional experiences, Kathy Stewart has developed a practical guide for caregivers. The book is easy to read, yet it provides a wealth of useful information which is accessible to all. It should provide knowledge and comfort for anyone caring for an individual with dementia.&lt;br&gt;
George A. Kuchel, M.D., FRCPC, Professor, Citicorp Chair in Geriatrics &amp; Gerontology, Director, UConn Center on Aging, University of Connecticut Health Center&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Stewart has provided an outstanding, informative, and useful guide. This book is required reading for all adult children and caregivers who seek to provide the best possible care for Mom and Dad. I wish I had this book when my own mother developed stroke-related dementia and needed extensive specialized care.&lt;br&gt;
