  <title>Pen to Paper - Adriel T. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;As a former athlete unable to express himself the way he wanted to, Adriel found comfort in expressing his love, his pain and the passion he has for basketball and for life through his poetry. Pen to Paper: A Transfer of Emotions is the manifestation of Adriel&#39;s passion for life, love and basketball. In college and throughout his life, he was a shoulder to many of his family and friends&#39; deepest and darkest secrets. Unable to tell others of the problems he faced and the struggles of people who had confided in him, he learned to put his pen to paper and a book was born. A deep look into a man&#39;s soul who so desperately wanted to heal himself and those who would seek his advice, Adriel began to search deep into his heart and soul to express those feelings for others. Pen to Paper is a book that will show you tears of joy, laughter and pain until the game is over.&lt;/P&gt;" />
