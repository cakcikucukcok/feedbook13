It was very scenic.The children decided they would have a contest with the other children to see who could make the best Snowman in the neighborhood. They used some very beautiful buttons that looked like snowflakes that were very important to the sister. They worked non-stop on this project.

Their Snow Break was over. However, they have bragging rights at school on The Best Snowman in their neighborhood. Their families were also very proud of there children for all the imagination and hard work." />
