  <title>To the End of the Earth - Tom Avery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;April 2009 is the one-hundredth anniversary of perhaps the greatest controversy in the history of exploration. Did U.S. Naval Commander Robert Peary and his team dogsled to the North Pole in thirty-seven days in 1909? Or, as has been challenged, was this speed impossible, and was he a cheat? In 2005, polar explorer Tom Avery and his team set out to recreate this 100-year-old journey, using the same equipment as Peary, to prove that Peary had indeed done what he had claimed and discovered the North Pole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating treacherous pressure ridges, deadly channels of open water, bitterly cold temperatures, and traveling in a similar style to Peary&#39;s with dog teams and replica wooden sledges bound together with cord, Avery tells the story of how his team covered 413 nautical miles to the North Pole in thirty-six days and twenty-two hours--some four hours faster than Peary. Weaving fascinating polar exploration history with thrilling extreme adventure, this is Avery&#39;s story of how he and his team nearly gave their lives proving Peary told the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
