  <title>I&#39;m More Than the Pastor&#39;s Wife - Lorna Dobson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lorna Dobson knows firsthand the struggles and joys of being married to a pastor—and the questions, not the least of which is, “What is a ‘pastor&#39;s wife,’ anyway?” As her poll of hundreds of women reveals, the wife of a minister is rarely the piano-playing, committee-leading stereotype.With humor, disarming genuineness, personal stories, and wisdom rooted in Scripture, Dobson cuts through the labels. “How I live has little to do with whether my husband is a pastor; rather, my life reflects my growth, or lack of it, as a Christian.” In this revised edition of I’m More Than the Pastor’s Wife, she includes new perspectives as a grandparent, soon-to-be empty-nester, and speaker. Here are frontline insights on·Making friends and cultivating personal support outside the church·Learning to handle expectations and pressures·Balancing time and using your gifts·Supporting your husband and growing closer to him·Prioritizing prayer for your husband, family, and church·Knowing your capabilities and limits·Dealing with “problem people” and church conflicts . . . and much more!" />
