  <title>Traveling Light - Andrea Thalasinos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paula Makaikis is ashamed of her marriage. Driven out of their bedroom by Roger&#39;s compulsive hoarding, she has spent the past ten years sleeping downstairs on her husband&#39;s ratty couch. Distant and uninspired, Paula is more concerned with the robins landing on her office window ledge than her hard-earned position at the university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a phone call changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homeless Greek man is dying in a Queens hospital and Paula is asked to come translate. The old man tells her of his beloved dog, Fotis, who bit a police officer when they were separated. Paula has never considered adopting a dog, but she promises the man that she will rescue Fotis and find him a good home. But when Fotis enters her life she finds a companion she can&#39;t live without. Suddenly Paula has a dog, a brand-new Ford Escape, an eight-week leave of absence, and a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Fotis and Paula begin the longest drive of their lives. In northern Minnesota, something compels her to answer a help-wanted ad for a wildlife rehabilitation center. Soon Paula is holding an eagle in her hands, and the experience leaves her changed forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inspiring story about fate, family, and healing, this novel explores what is possible when we cut the ties that hold us down and the heart is free to soar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traveling Light&lt;/i&gt; by Andrea Thalasinos is an inspiring story about fate, family, and healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
