  <title>Behind the Blue Beret - Jonathan Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Behind the Blue Beret is my memoir of my military enlistment in the United States Air Force as a Security Forces Member.   Not only have I been involved in a number of law enforcement situations, air base defense attacks in a location that only a select few service members have ever traveled in, and humorous personal situations to boot. But I received numerous injuries to my back, and psychological trauma that relates to several million newer and hundreds of millions of older veterans throughout the world.   For years when I was in the military I experienced so much and had a feeling of honor, courage, and self worth. I want to transfer this into my book. I have lived my life as a military member and take with me the stories, comradery, feelings, and situations with every chapter of this book that my fellow veterans can take with them and identify in their readings." />
