  <title>How Far Is Forward? - Dr. George M. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My military career ended with honor
at the time President Lyndon B.
Johnson was the Commander in Chief
of these United States. I served in the
United States Coast Guard, the United
States Navy, and the United States
Army in combat during the World
War II, Korea, and Viet Nam. When
my military career ended, I entered a
job market in which civil rights had
become a reality. Therefore, with my
education, electronic training, and motivation, I was able to secure
a job working for the Minolta Corporation. My military service
and my employment at Minolta enabled me to support my family:
three boys and one girl who are all adults now. In looking back over
my life, my memories of a strong religious upbringing brought me
back to the church. As a result, I found myself being called into the
ministry. Following Gods directions, I found myself moving from
Browns Mills, New Jersey to Columbia, South Carolina. Presently,
I serve as founder and president of Worthy is the Lamb Outreach
Ministries (Revelation 5:12). Therefore, proceeds from the book will
be used in funding programs for the elderly, the sick, and the needy
through my ministry. To God Be the glory!" />
