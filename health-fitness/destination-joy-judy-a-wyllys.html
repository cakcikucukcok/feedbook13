  <title>Destination: Joy! - Judy A. Wyllys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your Destination: Joy 
Have you felt more like a victim versus a victor in life? 
Are the hurts and troubles of life getting you down and you feel 
there is no hope? 
Join Judy Wyllys, the Joyologist, in how to discover the power of joy. Joy is unaffected by the hurts and circumstances of life. In fact, the power of joy is at its best under pressure when trouble is present. Using this foundational scripture, the joy of the Lord is my strength, (Nehemiah 8:10b). learn how joy actually thrives when times are tough. 
Joy is powerful. Its a tough cookie when you tap into this force. As an attribute of God the Father this strength, called joy, will create a fortified place, a fort, a defense for you in the midst of trouble and pressure. With humor and life experiences, Judy will show you how to tap into the force of joy. Learn how to keep the power of joy flowing from within and in the middle of any tough situation. You will experience step-by-step, how-to, instruction to ignite JOY, as you stand steadfast, full of enduring strength until the time of trouble is over. 
You will discover how to fully activate the force of joy and rise above the issues of life instead of crumbling under them. Happiness is wimpy, but joy is powerful! Get ready to be your own Joyologist in Destination: Joy" />
