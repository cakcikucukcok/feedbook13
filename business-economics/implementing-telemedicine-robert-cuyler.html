    Telemedicine works and can provide cost effective care to patients in remote locations. Thats the good news. The bad news is that a telemedicine practice
    is very difficult to implement. This book can help you and your organization prosper with a telemedicine practice, not create a storeroom with expensive,
    dust covered technology. This book will show you how to excel at leading change in todays complex healthcare environment, an environment that can mean
    success or failure for those wishing to implement telemedicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The managers who will be successful in implementing telemedicine today and tomorrow will be the ones who can look at waves of change and see opportunity;
    who can design a telemedicine vision and strategy for a more positive future for their organizations; and who can implement their designs  on target, on
    time, and on budget  by capitalizing on the strengths of their organizations and their bright and dedicated associates.
&lt;/p&gt;

    You dont have to be afraid of change any longer! Dutchs work offers entertaining and simple solutions that will help you move swiftly and efficiently
    through the growing pains of organizational change, says Ken Blanchard, author of The Secret and The One Minute Manager.
