  <title>Rebecca, Born in the Maelstrom - Marie-Claire Blais, Nigel Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With this astounding fourth novel in her ongoing series of contemporary masterpieces (&lt;em&gt;These Festive Nights&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thunder and Light&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Augustino and the Choir of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rebecca, Born in the Maelstrom&lt;/em&gt;), Marie-Claire Blais invites us again to enter a complex circle of unforgettable characters. But this time, the tone is different: Blais&#39; writing has acquired a new, buoyant, electrifying rhythm -- a rhythm some critics have described as the heartbeat of the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As we follow a central character named Rebecca, the voice in the novel becomes the voice of the world inventing itself, and the future playing itself out. As the GG jury wrote, this breathtaking paroxysm of a novel turns any commonly held vision of the world upside down. Blais&#39; transcendent prose illuminates her characters with an extraordinary light.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nigel Spencer is Marie-Claire Blais&#39; long-time translator and a Governor General&#39;s Award winner for his work on this series of books. He gives us Blais&#39; singular vision in supple English prose that is as transcendent and nuanced as the original French.&lt;/p&gt;" />
