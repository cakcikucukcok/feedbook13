  <title>The Male Teenager&#39;s Nine Middle Signs of Alcoholism - Becki Bateman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people still carry a stereotypical image of who an alcoholic is and what he or she does. The trouble is that this stereotype applies to only the chronic stage of alcoholisma stage that only represents 3 percent of the alcoholic population. What about the other 97 percent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Male Teenagers 9 Middle Signs of Alcoholism, authors Becki Bateman with Dave Payne explore the fact that while many teens would be part of that 97 percent, most have a tough time accepting the fact that they might be alcoholics. One in ten people who drink in the US are alcoholicsapproximately 17.6 million people. Whats more, each alcoholic directly affects five to eight people, including their mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, children, closest relatives, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Male Teenagers 9 Middle Signs of Alcoholism is the second book in the ALERT (Actual Learning Examples to Recognize Trouble) series, and it continues where volume one ended by providing more examples of behaviors in teens that might indicate that they have a potential drinking problem. These guides are informative and easy to read, offering resources and explaining where and how to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed for use not only by teens but also by parents, friends, or anyone concerned about helping a friend or loved one, this guide provides the help needed to beat teen alcoholism before its too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
