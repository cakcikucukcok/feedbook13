  <title>The Ambiguity of Murder - Roderic Jeffries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the body of retired Bolivian diplomat Guido Zavala is found floating in his swimming pool, Inspector Alvarez finds evidence that points to foul play. Though the Inspector would rather be sipping a brandy in the shade, he begins to look for suspects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alvarez digs further into Zavala&#39;s past, he quickly uncovers a history of dubious acts that had left Zavala with numerous enemies-each with plenty of motive to see him dead. There is Jerome Robertson, whose beautiful and much younger wife had been involved in an affair with Zavala; Santiago Pons, a builder whose gambling debts had left him at Zavala&#39;s mercy; and Bailey, an honorable man who had suffered at the hands of Zavala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper he delves into the case, the more Alvarez begins to find himself in danger. After a series of phone calls that make it all too clear he could be the next victim, he appeals to Superior Chief Salas for help and is denied. Will Alvarez be able to weed through the long list of suspects before it&#39;s too late? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffries delivers yet another delightful and witty mystery featuring &quot;the brandy-loving, slow-moving&quot; (Booklist) Inspector Alvarez.&lt;/p&gt;" />
