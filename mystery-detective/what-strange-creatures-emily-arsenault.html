  <title>What Strange Creatures - Emily Arsenault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Scandal, love, family, and murder combine in this gripping literary mystery by critically acclaimed author Emily Arsenault, in which a young academic&amp;#8217;s life is turned upside down when her brother is arrested for murder and she must prove his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battle siblings are used to disappointment. Seven years, one marriage and divorce, three cats, and a dog later, Theresa still hasn&amp;#8217;t finished her dissertation. Instead of a degree, she&amp;#8217;s got a houseful of adoring pets and a dead-end copywriting job for a local candle company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff, her so-called genius older brother, doesn&amp;#8217;t have it together, either. Creative, and loyal, he&amp;#8217;s also aimless in work and love. But his new girlfriend, Kim, a pretty waitress in her twenties, appears smitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Theresa agrees to dog-sit Kim&amp;#8217;s puggle for a weekend, she has no idea that it is the beginning of a terrifying nightmare that will shatter her quiet world. Soon, Kim&amp;#8217;s body will be found in the woods, and Jeff will become the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the evidence is overwhelming, Theresa knows that her brother is not a cold-blooded murderer. But to clear him she must find out more about Kim. Investigating the dead woman&amp;#8217;s past, Theresa uncovers a treacherous secret involving politics, murder, and scandal&amp;#8212;and becomes entangled in a potentially dangerous romance. But the deeper she falls into this troubling case, the more it becomes clear that, in trying to save her brother&amp;#8217;s life, she may be sacrificing her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
