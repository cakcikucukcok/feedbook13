  <title>Dennis Maruk - Ken Reid, Dennis Maruk, Marcel Dionne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From feared NHL sniper to ship captain and bellhop — with hockey’s greatest ‘stache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 20 men in NHL history have scored 60 or more goals in a single season: Gretzky, Lemieux, and Hull all hit the magical mark. And so did an undersized, take-no-prisoners centre named Dennis Maruk. When Maruk found the back of the net 60 times in 1981–82, he was the toast of Washington — he even dined with the president. A few short years later, he was out of the game. Maruk not only left the rink, his life did a complete 180. Instead of flying up the ice and in on goal, he was behind the wheel of a service ship in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of setting up teammates, he was setting up furniture for Goldie Hawn. He was never sent down to the farm as a rookie, but after the game he was a farmhand for John Oates. And instead of fighting in the corners, Dennis Maruk found himself fighting for his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
