  <title>I See, My Meadow, I See - Nina Yiannopoulou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Meadow: 
The eternal landscape of our souls 
under the sunlight and darkness
of the aspects of modern life,
such as
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS:
And we were wondering
 what were the first of us following?
We didnt know,
 not even this time.
FAMILY:
	Your fears
are the robbers of my happiness,
Mum.
Send them to prison
and give me a hug.
LOVE:
Additionally, loves cosmogonic action
finally induces catharsis or disaster
like every healthy storm.
TRAVELLING: 
A take-off
 thats the point.
 	Whichever take-off
	but now.
SCIENCE: 
Whenever time drifts by you     
it becomes integral and moist.
Whenever you push the time
you find it uncompressed.
ART:
I think that this is the way that poetry is used to appear.
Through cracks.
On the wall.
ILLUSIONS:
Panthers with chained hunger
stalk the end of the party.
ENVIRONMENT:
	But you arent listening to me, city, you arent.
And you are making noise.
If you cant speak spotlessly,
at least shut up.
MOURNING:
Acceptance of the perishable stoically,
reception of the death well meaning.
Perhaps even for the most beloved.
And coconuts in free fall." />
