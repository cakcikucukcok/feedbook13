  <title>Love Yourself Before You Destroy Yourself and Miss Your Blessings - Hattie Ann Gregory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a dynamic sermon, like teaching, on loving yourself before you destroy yourself and miss your blessings. Love is the greatest gift you can give to yourself. Loving yourself is also the greatest gift that you can give to others. When you love yourself, you are more relaxed and content with yourself as well as other people. Loving God and his Son, Jesus, is the first and greatest gift of all. Loving ourselves helps us to fulfill the second commandmentto extend such love to others and to the world. 
This book presents to you many of the tools you need in order to apply yourself with the love that you deserve. If you do not know how to receive the love, you need to overcome feelings of unworthiness that were fed into you in the past. This book can help you. It shares with you how to receive the benefits of living the abundant life that you where intended to live. 
For a long time, I experienced significant damage from not loving myself. This can destroy a person mentally, emotionally, and socially and keep him or her from obtaining the abundant, happy life that God intended for all of his children to have. I hope that by applying the tools that this book offers, you will understand and follow the way that has helped me. Love Yourself Before You Destroy Yourself and Miss Your Blessings will teach you how to walk in love, faith, and confidence, knowing that you are made in the image of God." />
