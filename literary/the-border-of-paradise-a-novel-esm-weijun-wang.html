  <title>The Border of Paradise: A Novel - Esmé Weijun Wang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In booming postwar Brooklyn, the Nowak Piano Company is an American success story. There is just one problem: the Nowak&amp;#8217;s only son, David. A handsome kid and shy like his mother, David struggles with neuroses. If not for his only friend, Marianne, David&amp;#8217;s life would be intolerable. When David inherits the piano company at just 18 and Marianne breaks things off, David sells the company and travels around the world. In Taiwan, his life changes when he meets the daughter of a local madame &amp;#151; the sharp-tongued, intelligent Daisy. Returning to the United States, the couple (and newborn son) buy an isolated country house in Northern California&amp;#8217;s Polk Valley. As David&#39;s health deteriorates, he has a brief affair with Marianne, producing a daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Daisy&#39;s solution for the future of her two children, inspired by the old Chinese tradition of raising girls as sisterly wives for adoptive brothers, that exposes Daisy&amp;#8217;s traumatic life, and the terrible inheritance her children must receive. Framed by two suicide attempts, &lt;I&gt;The Border of Paradise&lt;/I&gt; is told from multiple perspectives, culminating in heartrending fashion as the young heirs to the Nowak fortune confront their past and their isolation.&lt;/div&gt;" />
