Joining a gang doesn&#39;t make sense to Jimmy...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy is dead now&amp;#8212;gunned down in front of his little sister, Mina, and his brother, Tito. And Tito is left wondering: Was Jimmy in a gang after all? Ice Breaker Joe and Lamar think so. They say Jimmy was skimming their drug money. And if the missing cash isn&#39;t returned, Tito may have to pay&amp;#8212;with his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people go to the crossroads, but Tito&#39;s crossroads laid themselves down in front of him. His brother Jimmy sprawls on the sidewalk at his feet. Shot in a drive by. Now a gang claims that Jimmy was their Ace Man. They say Tito must take his place and resolve some unfinished business. They give him a gun. &quot;You need protection. It&#39;s not safe on the street.&quot; What path will be choose at the crossroads? He knows one leads to safety and one to death . . . but which is which? &lt;/p&gt;" />
