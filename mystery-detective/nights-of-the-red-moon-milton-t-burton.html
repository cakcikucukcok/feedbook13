  <title>Nights of the Red Moon - Milton T. Burton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small town, meet big crime. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not hard for longtime Sheriff Bo Handel to keep Texas&#39; Caddo County in line. He handles petty crimes and rabble rousers, runs a competent police force and maintains a relationship with his steady girlfriend while keeping things quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the local minister&#39;s wife, Amanda Twiller, is murdered and dumped on the church&#39;s front, Bo suddenly finds himself with his hands full. Unfortunately for Bo, finding Amanda&#39;s killer won&#39;t be as easy as rounding up the town&#39;s usual suspects. He&#39;ll have to get past sleazy attorneys and drug lords first. When he discovers that Amanda was not only addicted to narcotics but also having an affair with one of the roughest men in town, the lazy days of his past are a distant memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Bo realizes there are only so many cocaine kings and Mob bosses that one man can juggle. But the murderer is out there, and it&#39;s up to Bo to find out who it is. This small town sheriff is used to a light workload. So what happens when heavy crime comes to town?&lt;/p&gt;" />
