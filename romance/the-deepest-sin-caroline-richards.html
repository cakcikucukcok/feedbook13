  <title>The Deepest Sin - Caroline Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Perfect Revenge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Lady Meredith Woolcott thinks she is safe, the nightmare returns. A madman who will stop at nothing has her in his sights once more. This time, she must escape his clutches forever, or die trying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dangerous Deceit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protecting Meredith was never part of Sir Richard Archer&#39;s assignment. His duty is to pursue her.  .  . follow her every move.  .  . and let her be the bait that draws a murderous villain out of the shadows and into his grasp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ultimate Risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against his orders and his every instinct, Archer refuses to let Meredith endanger herself--and she refuses to relent, forcing them to partner together to ferret out the threat. But the inferno of passion between them has its own seductive dangers, putting their trust to the test at every deadly turn.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A finely wrought tale, rife with twisting secrets and dangerous hungers. Exquisite!&quot; --Sylvia Day on &lt;i&gt;The Deadliest Sin&lt;/i&gt;" />
