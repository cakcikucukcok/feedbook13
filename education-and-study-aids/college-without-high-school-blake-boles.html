I&amp;#160;highly recommend Blake&#39;s book to any middle school or high school student seeking more excitement and engagement in their educational journey. Smart parents should buy this book for their kids and be bold enough to encourage them to forge ahead in new ways. &quot; - Maya Frost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoFooter&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoFooter&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .5in;&quot;&gt;High school can be boring. High school curriculum can be frustrating and out of touch. So what is the answer for young people whose creativity, bright ideas, and boundless energy are being stifled in that over-scheduled and grade-driven environment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you could go to college without going to high school? Would you travel abroad, spend late nights writing a novel, volunteer in an emergency room, or build your own company? What dreams would you be pursuing right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;College Without High School&lt;/I&gt; shows how independent teens can self-design their high school education by becoming unschooled. Students begin by defining their goals and dreams and then pursue them through a combination of meaningful and engaging adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to pursue your dreams and gain admission to any college of your choice. The guidebook shows how to fulfill college admission requirements by proving five preparatory results: intellectual passion, leadership, logical reasoning, background knowledge, and the capacity for structured learning. The author, who leads teenage unschoolers on educational adventures, offers several suggestions for life-changing, confidence-building activities that will demonstrate those results. This intriguing approach&lt;/div&gt;" />
