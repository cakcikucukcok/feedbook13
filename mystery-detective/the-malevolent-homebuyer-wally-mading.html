  <title>The Malevolent Homebuyer - Wally Mading</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the past 25 years, over 250 real-estate agents have been assaulted on the job. Many
of them raped and murdered. Charlie Daniels, president of Montanas largest board of
Realtors, read this statement to his associates. It was from the National Association of
Realtors and arrived only days before the first-ever rape-murder of a city Realtor. Another
killing followed.
A rapist-killer is now established and on the prowl in Montanas largest city and
he leaves no evidence. He has a fixation on beautiful real-estate women with black hair.
He is a lawmans worst nightmarea rapist-killer from a distant place with two years spent
building local trust. Now, he has a plan to rape and kill, and repeat his grisly work.
The killings send a message to female Realtorsa killer walks among us, business
as usual is over. Women are the backbone of the real-estate sales force, but apprehension
hangs in the air. Sally Stokes, attractive middle-aged widow with two young daughters,
cannot afford to hole up. Neither can gorgeous Sheena Lovely, the rumored great-grand
daughter of Montana native Gary Cooper.
Law enforcement is stymied. They look to a retired man-hunter, Sheriff Wade
Hollingsworth, for input, but his conclusion is surreal, the contrast too largewould a
killer leave the protective concealment of peopled Seattle for the vastness of Montana?
Two years past, the Seattle media tagged a similar killer, The Taker. Can The Taker really
be in Montana, operating under a guise of innocence?
When the aging sheriffs beautiful protg Sheena is taken, he acts on his hunch.
Alone he trudges to a suspected wilderness hide-away where he finds herhopeless
waiting. Now they must elude the returning sadist. Apprehensively, they start an arduous
trip out of the mountains with no conception of the horror awaiting them." />
