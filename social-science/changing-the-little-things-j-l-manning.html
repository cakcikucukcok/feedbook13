  <title>Changing the Little Things - J. L. Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a fictional author who has a really different idea for a new book. Now, this author is pretty well off, but he has an idea of how to change things in his life. He feels that his life is good, so he writes a book about this idea. This fictional author goes online to a blog site where people complain about their own lives.  
The author invites eleven people to a private chat room to introduce his idea to them. They meet three nights a week to talk about the topics that are of interest to them: family, work, and friends. These are the topics that the bloggers would like to have an effect on. Will their active blogging on these topics have a profound effect upon their lives? 
Changing the Little Things, which is written primarily in blog format, contains twelve unfinished stories that are relevant to most people today. In these stories, the author points out how to find the little things in life and how to affect them to cause great change." />
