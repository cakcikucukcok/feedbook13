  <title>Motherhood Reimagined - Sarah Kowalski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• More and more women are putting off childbirth until later in life to pursue careers and enter motherhood with more maturity, only to find out they are infertile; since 1990, the birthrate has tripled for women 40 and older, even though a woman’s chance of conceiving naturally is less than 5% per cycle by age 40. 
• Because of advanced maternal age, the number of women using egg donors to conceive is on the rise; 12% of all IVF cycles in the US utilize donor eggs, and the number of donor egg cycles performed increased from 10,801 in 2000 to 18,306 in 2010. 
• 7.5 million women aged 15-44 suffer from fertility issues. 
• 6.9 million women (11.3% of women aged 15-44) have used infertility services. 
• An increasing number of older, single women are proactively choosing single motherhood via sperm donation; in 2009, 41% of all live births were to single mothers, compared to 11% in 1970. 
• Fertility tourism is on the rise due to rising costs of fertility treatment and lack of insurance coverage for infertility. Some states have a mandate under Obamacare, which may no longer exists, to provide treatment for fertility but it often excludes IVF and egg donation and in other ways defines infertility such that it is impossible for a single woman to get coverage. Patients seeking fertility treatments in Mexico can save 40-65% on treatment." />
