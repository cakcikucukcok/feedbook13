      <meta name="description" content="ID# 14246476. An ePub for the entire family to use as a guide for enjoying and discovering what is in your backyard.  Color photographs, easy reading and big letters.  At first you don&#39;t see much, a fence, a tree and maybe a bird. But when you take some time to really look closely at different areas of your back yard you will find a gold mine of entertainment. To name just a few: Birds, animals, trees, plants, bugs, daytime sky, nighttime sky, bees, butterflies, grass, snow, leaves, sounds of dogs barking, cars, planes, silence, wind, outside furniture, houses, a place to play, eat, rest, relax, think, write and spend time with family and friends. There is more but you must take the time to find them and enjoy what you have." />
