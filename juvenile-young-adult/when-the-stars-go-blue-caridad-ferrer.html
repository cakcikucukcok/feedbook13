  <title>When the Stars Go Blue - Caridad Ferrer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of an International Latino Book Award, When the Stars Go Blue is a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; contemporary interpretation of Bizet&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Carmen &lt;/i&gt;in which the fiery gypsy is reinvented as a modern-day dancer, torn between the attentions of an intense, disciplined music prodigy and a flamboyant soccer player.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance is Soledad Reyes&#39;s life. About to graduate from Miami&#39;s Biscayne High School for the Performing Arts, she plans on spending her last summer at home teaching in a dance studio, saving money, and eventually auditioning for dance companies. That is, until fate intervenes in the form of fellow student Jonathan Crandall who has what sounds like an outrageous proposition: Forget teaching. Why not spend the summer performing in the intense environment of the competitive drum and bugle corps? The corps is going to be performing &lt;i&gt;Carmen&lt;/i&gt;, and the opportunity to portray the character of the sultry gypsy proves too tempting for Soledad to pass up, as well as the opportunity to spend more time with Jonathan, who intrigues her in a way no boy ever has before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in an uncanny echo of the story they perform every evening, an unexpected competitor for Soledad&#39;s affections appears: Taz, a member of an all-star Spanish soccer team. One explosive encounter later Soledad finds not only her relationship with Jonathan threatened, but her entire future as a professional dancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
