  <title>Communication in Organizations - Dave Tofanelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The future of business communications is a fully interconnected world where every employee will access, create and use content from anywhere. At the same time, companies want to keep their employees connected anytime or anywhere. Employees are no longer tied to their desktops, and they want the same communications options on the road or from home that they have in the office. Face-to-face communication is quickly becoming a lost art in this age of e-mail, texting and voicemail. But ultimately, when it comes to engaging an audience or making a compelling sales presentation, business is still driven by personal communication. High technology sets the stage, but speaking face-to-face seals the deal. Lack of communicative ability plagues many corporations, and the professionals that rise to the top are overwhelming those that develop communication approaches that achieve results. But, communicating with influence takes work and requires constant attention. This text will assist you in understanding types of communication, explain how successful communication takes place, and suggest ways of improving communication." />
