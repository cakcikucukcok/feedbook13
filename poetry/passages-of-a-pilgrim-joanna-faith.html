  <title>Passages of a Pilgrim - Joanna Faith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetic book shares poetry written from 1996 to 2016. PASSAGES OF A PILGRIM reveals deeply personal  poems about the passages of life that we can experience as humans. 
Observations, feelings and perspectives from a Biblical view are in the 210 poems that are spiritual seeds of hope, love, joy and dreams after the 20 past years full of sorrow and pain. In Jeremiah 29:11, we read God wants to give us a hope and a good future. All of us experience the hills, mountains and valleys. The author has been inspired by beauty, impressions and visions like ancient mystics. [Bible verses were added after the poems were writ-ten to compliment and confirm the spiritual truths]. 
Chapter titles include these topics: Poems of given or lost love, poems of issues, spiritual poems, poems of Trinity, poems about earth and heaven, poems of our family and beauty, poems of healing after deep pain, poems of divine messages. 
This book is a modern type of Pilgrim&#39;s Progress from a nurse, philosopher, traveler, reader, writer, actress, sing-er, minister,, missionary kid, pastor&#39;s kid, and believer in Creator God: Holy Trinity.  
The author has lived over 58 years. She dedicates her spiritual book of wis-dom to all the precious people who will read of her journey of loss and her deep faith. She knows how painful loss, illness and betrayals wound us. She has learned that God wants us to heal and be restored. She prays that the book will bless, inspire, heal, teach and transform the readers." />
