  <title>Forks in the Road - John T. Sullivan Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in the 1950s and 60s in a small upstate NY city, the author has interacted with many of the communitys leading lights, and has lots of stories to tell, and reminiscences to share. It could be a book about anywhere USA, and in reading the compendium of columns, the reader will get to know people they dont know, and will feel as if they did know them. John Sullivan is good at giving eulogies, and good at telling stories, particularly about people he has known and admired. Each brief biographical sketch gives you not only an understanding of the person and their times, but a feel for the contributions their lives made in the overall quality of life in their communities. As a daughter of one of the subjects wrote to the author, You gave my mother a great gift-recognition for her lifes achievements She was uplifted by your telling of her story, and we are forever grateful to you for putting the cherry on top of her career.  Memories, in the end, are all we have, and the sweeter the memory, the more appreciation there is for lives well lived. There are lots of sweet memories, and lifes lessons learned in this book. The author hopes you enjoy reading about them as much as he enjoyed writing about them." />
