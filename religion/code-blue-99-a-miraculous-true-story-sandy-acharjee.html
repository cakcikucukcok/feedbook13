  <title>Code Blue 99! -  a Miraculous True Story! - Sandy Acharjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author was born and raised in an orthodox Hindu family. Like most of us, he was busy with his family, career and day-to-day activities. Then suddenly, out of the blue, in the ICU room of a modern hospital, he had a Code Blue experience when he unexpectedly departed this world for a period of three days. 
This book has been written per Gods instructions, whom he met during the traumatic period of his life. This is a miraculous true story, and the author is a living testimony of what truly transpires after our physical death here on earth. There should be no doubt for anyone that both the Heaven and the Hell exist in our after-life. The author has witnessed both of them. Based on his afterlife experience he has found that it is very easy to enter into the Hell. But, it is extremely difficult to enter into the Heaven as he witnessed the one and the only narrow entrance door.
This book solidifies the Truth by unfolding the blindfolds of our life, tells who we really are, the real purpose of our life here on earth, and what is expected of us in order to enter into the Heavenly Kingdom. It is all based on the authors firsthand experience and personal encounter with the Divine Light.  
Finally, it reiterates his face-to-face conversation with the Lord, who sent him back to the earth to share His Instructions for everyone, whether they be believers or non-believers. Some Readers Testimonials from different corners of the world are included in the final section of the Second Edition of this book. This book is a Must Read for everyone It is all based upon a Miraculous True Story!" />
