      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love never dies...but apparently Rachel has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waking up to her obituary in the news and no recollection of the past few weeks, Rachel turns to her husband, Nate.

But the answers Nate has are not the answers Rachel wants to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he arrives home, Rachel doesn&#39;t recognize the man who claims to be her husband. But there&#39;s something about him that tugs at her heartstrings, even as her distrust grows. Can Nate convince Rachel to fall in love with him all over again? Especially once she realizes what he&#39;s done...and what it means for their future?&lt;/p&gt;" />
