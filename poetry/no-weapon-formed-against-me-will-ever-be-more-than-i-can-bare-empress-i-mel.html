  <title>No Weapon Formed Against Me Will Ever Be More Than I Can Bare - Empress I’ Mel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come with me on a poetical journey of a lifetime.
Through the joys, realisations, painful aspects and experiences in my life. In this book you are bound to experience every form of emotion going. You will see how much times I fell or was failed before I finally stood back up. Throughout this book you will be inspired in every shape and form at times I also offer further advice into certain experiences of life and how we can do our best to turn it all around. We should not allow ourselves to be governed by the things that other people do or say to us. Because you are somebody all on your own and you have been someone since you was conceived. The title of this book is Biblical and it locks together the awesome promises which God gave to us. Which are No weapon formed against you shall prosper and that God will Never allow you to go through more than you can bare. 
Read the book and you will be aware of that promise at work in my life and yours also. This book can help those who have gone through or are going through to regain some hope and to take back power from their pain
My dream for this book is that it will serve as a manual for those 
Who think there is no escape from the pain. Hopeful it will lead them to seek or enter into a life of unique oneness with ones self and understand their connection to the world they experience outside of themselves. Therefore they will no longer be a prisoner of their own captivity." />
