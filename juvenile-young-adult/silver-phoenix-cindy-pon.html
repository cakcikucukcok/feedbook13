  <title>Silver Phoenix - Cindy Pon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one wanted Ai Ling. And deep down she is relieved&amp;#8212;despite the dishonor she has brought upon her family&amp;#8212;to be unbetrothed and free, not some stranger&#39;s subservient bride banished to the inner quarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, something is after her. Something terrifying&amp;#8212;a force she cannot comprehend. And as pieces of the puzzle start to fit together, Ai Ling begins to understand that her journey to the Palace of Fragrant Dreams isn&#39;t only a quest to find her beloved father but a venture with stakes larger than she could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bravery, intelligence, the will to fight and fight hard . . . she will need all of these things. Just as she will need the new and mysterious power growing within her. She will also need help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Chen Yong who finds her partly submerged and barely breathing at the edge of a deep lake. There is something of unspeakable evil trying to drag her under. On a quest of his own, Chen Yong offers that help . . . and perhaps more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
