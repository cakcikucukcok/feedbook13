  <title>Of Bears, Wolves and Men: in Homage to the Wild - Joan Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nature has the upper hand in this compelling story of the North Fork of the Flathead, Montana, adjacent to Glacier National Park. Participate in the family adventures and remarkable events that were a daily occurrence in one of the few remaining wild areas in the lower 48. True tales from the past and present interweave in a parade of unique human characters, as does action at the loneliest border crossing in America. Learn of the interaction between predators and their plight as they attempt to survive in this remnant of habitat. Follow the wildlife researchers as they trap, collar, then monitor grizzlies, cougars, wolves and coyotes. Details of wildlife research in the field can be extraordinary. This tells it like it is. Pity poor Luke, a male grizzly crippled by a gunshot. Admire Thunder, old for a coyote, in spite of wolves and humans. Stay away from the Dollman, living deep within Canadian forests. Beware of the tire-slasher as he travels the lonely road. What really did happen at the cabin of the infamous Madam Queen, who instigated murder? Hardship, fires, floodall are part of the North Fork history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
