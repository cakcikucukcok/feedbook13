  <title>Improvement - Joan Silber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The splendid new novel by the critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Fools&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ideas of Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, a Finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of our most gifted writers of fiction returns with a bold and piercing novel about a young single mother living in Harlem, her eccentric aunt, and the decisions they make that have unexpected implications for the world around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reyna knows her relationship with Boyd isn’t perfect, yet she sees him through a three-month stint at Riker&#39;s Island, their bond growing tighter. Kiki, now settled in the East Village after a youth that took her to Turkey and other far off places—and loves—around the world, admires her niece’s spirit but worries that motherhood to four-year old Oliver might complicate a difficult situation. Little does she know that Boyd is pulling Reyna into a smuggling scheme, across state lines, violating his probation. When Reyna takes a step back, her small act of resistance sets into motion a tapestry of events that affect the lives of loved ones and strangers around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A novel that examines conviction, connection, repayment, and the possibility of generosity in the face of loss, &lt;i&gt;Improvement&lt;/i&gt; is as intricately woven together as Kiki’s beloved Turkish rugs, as colorful as the tattoos decorating Reyna’s body, with narrative twists and turns as surprising and unexpected as the lives all around us. &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; said &quot;No other writer can make a few small decisions ripple across the globe, and across time, with more subtlety and power,&quot; and &lt;i&gt;Improvement&lt;/i&gt; is Silber&#39;s most shining achievement." />
