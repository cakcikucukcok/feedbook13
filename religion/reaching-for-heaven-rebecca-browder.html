  <title>Reaching for Heaven - Rebecca Browder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reaching for Heaven&lt;/b&gt; chronicles &lt;b&gt;Rebecca Browders&lt;/b&gt; struggle with the Proteus syndrome, a condition that involves atypical growth of the bones, skin, head, and a variety of other symptoms. Rebecca is dedicated to learning as much as she can and to sharing a positive outlook on life through her faith in her Savior, Jesus Christ. She has learned to overcome overwhelming obstacles because of her malformation and medial disabilities manifested by the Proteus syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca seeks to reach out to others who may be struggling with a disability or with a challenging life. By letting people know that they are not alone, Rebecca believes she is fulfilling Gods purpose for her. She believes that God doesnt take anything away from us to make us sad or hurt us, but rather to make us stronger so that we can reach out to others and treat them with loving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebeccas story is one of strength, challenges, and the understanding that God has something better in store for her. It has been challenging for her to go from being able to walk to being bed bound, but she understands that sometimes we have to accept the hardest things in life in order to receive better things in the future. Our faith and trust in God can carry us through our difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;" />
