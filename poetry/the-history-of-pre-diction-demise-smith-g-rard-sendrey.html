  <title>The History of Pre-Diction - Demise Smith, Gérard Sendrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Phil Demise Smith and Grard Sendrey have been nurturing their personal and professional
relationship for 15 years. They share space on both sides of the artistic fence
as organizers, representatives and creators of art, simultaneously. Grard founded
and was director of the Muse Cration Franche in Bgles, France while becoming one of Europes most prolific and sought after outsider artists. His recent retrospective in September 2010 exposed his many and varied styles and accompanying this exhibition, a beautiful catalogue was produced (available from Muse Cration Franche). Phil is a well-published poet, songwriter - performing musician, painter and artist representative (one of Grards representatives in the U.S.). This project was a labor of love. When Phil received this series of paintings from Grard, he was immediately inspired to react to the works through poetry. The result is this collaboration: The History of Pre-Diction.
The book itself contains reproductions of 23 small paintings (8&quot;x12&quot;,1998)) by Grard Sendrey and 23 concretely abstracted poems by Phil Demise Smith, each poem an associative response to
Sendreys surreal images. Both the paintings and the poems create the atmosphere of a futuristic fairy tale. &quot;Like a silent film, the language silently refers to the visual before a spoken language was heard (Pre-Diction).&quot;" />
