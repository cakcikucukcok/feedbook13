  <title>Legends and Rebels of the Football World - Norm Parkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Norman Parkin&#39;s exotic football career took him all around the world, and he&#39;s still coaching football teams in the Philippines.  On 8 November 2013, he touched down at Manila airport, as a natural disaster unfolded around him. He decided to do something to help: to write a book about some of football&#39;s greatest legends and rebels. Long-term aid is still desperately needed to rebuild shattered lives in the Philippines. Norman travelled up and down the UK, and spent hours on the phone to capture the stories of the heroes, villains and true characters of football, from Stanley Matthews to Malcolm Macdonald. On a quest to discover the true heart and soul of the beautiful game, he met ex-players in pubs, cafes, offices and radio stations. Open the pages to discover a world of blood, sweat and broken bones, a far cry from the multi-million pound game that football has become today.  All royalties after expenses from the sale of the book will go to the Philippines Typhoon Relief Fund." />
