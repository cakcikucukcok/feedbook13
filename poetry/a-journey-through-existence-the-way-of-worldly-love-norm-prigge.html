      <meta name="description" content="Preface &lt;p&gt;
I explicitly do not affirm the truth of any statement made or implied
herein concerning any actual people, including myself; or any actual
relationships, including my own; or any concrete situations depicted.
Everything I have written is either about or based upon my perceptions,
memories, imagining, suppositions, assessments of poetic and dramatic
appropriateness, and the like, all such, qua sources of factual truth, being
notoriously fallible. The only truth that I do affirm herein is that of the
universals that can be abstracted from the particulars of my subjective
experience, the universalscall them poetic truthswhereby my
audience can better understand and perfect themselves as I, hopefully,
have been able to do for myself in the living and subsequent describing
of all that follows. If anything I have written happens to occasion any
people pain, I express in anticipation my deepest compassion; such
people must know, however, that I would not have written as I have if
I did not suppose that I would thereby have caused, in potentiality, far
greater good than harm.
