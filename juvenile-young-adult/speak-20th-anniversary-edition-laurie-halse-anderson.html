  <title>Speak 20th Anniversary Edition - Laurie Halse Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A timeless novel about consent and finding the courage to speak up for yourself, the twentieth anniversary edition of the classic novel that has spoken to so many young adults now includes a new introduction by acclaimed writer, host, speaker, and cultural commentator Ashley C. Ford as well as an afterword by &lt;i&gt;New York Times-&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;All American Boys &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Long Way Down, &lt;/i&gt;Jason Reynolds.
