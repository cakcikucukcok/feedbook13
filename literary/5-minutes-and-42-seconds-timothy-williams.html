  <title>5 Minutes and 42 Seconds - Timothy Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Cameisha Douglass has it all -- a sprawling home in a posh neighborhood, a fancy car, three healthy children, and a husband, Fashad, who is devoted to her. Her biggest worry is catching her daytime soap operas before the kids come home from school and her husband returns from work, &quot;businesses&quot; that everyone knows are mere fronts through which he launders his drug-dealing money. But as the emotional and sexual secrets of her family come to the surface, she can no longer deny that her life is not all that it seems. While family members point fingers at one another, the real threat may come from the outside, specifically from Smokey, a mixed-race twenty-year-old high school dropout and would-be rapper whose issues with sexual and racial identity fuel his inner rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by a daring young author with a compelling voice, &lt;em&gt;5 Minutes and 42 Seconds&lt;/em&gt; is a fast-paced and edgy thriller that explores the questions of identity and sexuality with refreshing vigor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
