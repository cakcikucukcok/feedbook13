  <title>Everything That Makes You - Moriah McStay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder &amp;#34;What if?&amp;#34; &lt;em&gt;Everything That Makes You&lt;/em&gt; is a romantic, epic story about one girl&amp;#8212;and her two possible lives after an accident changes her fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiona Doyle&amp;#39;s face was horribly scarred as a child. She writes about her frustrations and dreams in notebooks, penning song lyrics. But she&amp;#39;d never be brave enough to sing those songs in public. Fi Doyle never had an accident. She&amp;#39;s the best lacrosse player in the state and can&amp;#39;t be distracted by her friend who wants to be more than that. But then her luck on the field goes south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternating chapters between Fiona and Fi tell two stories about the same girl&amp;#8212;hopes and dreams and crushes, fears and failures and loss. This beautifully written realistic contemporary novel with a twist is perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt; by Gayle Forman and &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; by Lauren Oliver.&lt;/p&gt;" />
