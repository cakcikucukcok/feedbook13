  <title>A Widow&#39;s Words: Letters to My Beloved - Cathy Penman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life rushes on for us all, our days filled with the mundane, the trivial, the routine.  Until sometimes, for some of us, something big and horrible and unexpected happens – like a bereavement.
The author of ‘A Widow’s Words’ has just lost her husband of nearly thirty years.  Partly as therapy, she spills out to us everything that has happened, and how it has made her feel.  She is driven to describe and capture as much as possible of her late-husband’s life and character, so as to somehow preserve him for posterity.  She wants the world to know what a wonderful person he was, and what an amazingly close and special relationship they had.
This book is an expression of grief.  Others who find themselves bereaved will associate with it, and may find the comments and observations helpful.  It if hasn’t happened to you, it may make you think ahead, and prepare." />
