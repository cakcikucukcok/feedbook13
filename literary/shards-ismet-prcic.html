  <title>Shards - Ismet Prcic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ismet Prcic&amp;#8217;s brilliant, provocative, and propulsory energetic debut is about a young Bosnian, also named Ismet Prcic, who has fled his war-torn homeland and is now struggling to reconcile his past with his present life in California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He is advised that in order to make peace with the corrosive guilt he harbors over leaving behind his family behind, he must &amp;#147;write everything.&amp;#8221; The result is a great rattlebag of memories, confessions, and fictions: sweetly humorous recollections of Ismet&amp;#8217;s childhood in Tuzla appear alongside anguished letters to his mother about the challenges of life in this new world. As Ismet&amp;#8217;s foothold in the present falls away, his writings are further complicated by stories from the point of view of another young man&amp;#151;real or imagined&amp;#151;named Mustafa, who joined a troop of elite soldiers and stayed in Bosnia to fight. When Mustafa&amp;#8217;s story begins to overshadow Ismet&amp;#8217;s new-world identity, the reader is charged with piecing together the fragments of a life that has become eerily unrecognizable, even to the one living it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Shards&lt;/I&gt; is a thrilling read&amp;#151;a harrowing war story, a stunningly inventive coming of age, and a heartbreaking saga of a splintered family.&lt;/div&gt;" />
