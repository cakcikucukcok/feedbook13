      <meta name="description" content="Faith over Fate
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me (Phil. 4:13).  scripture played a pivotal role in my life. When I was attacked by kidney disease, degenerative spine disease, blood disorder, sleeping sickness, and several kinds of cancer; when my physical strength failed, my faith strength remained (stayed). I learned how to live well in a sick body. I would always answer when asked how I was doing with Im just a fine and a dandy. Romans 4:17 says, Speaking those things that be not as though they were, and they will appear [emphasis] mine beloved. It is not enough to know about God and to live a life of deliverance in a world of destruction. You must know God in all his might. My Faith Journey is coming soon; be on the lookout for it. I pray that it will enlighten, encourage, and empower you to press onward." />
