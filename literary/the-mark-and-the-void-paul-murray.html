While marooned at his banking job in the bewilderingly damp and insular realm known as Ireland, Claude Martingale is approached by a down-on-his-luck author, Paul, looking for his next great subject. Claude finds that his life gets steadily more exciting under Paul&#39;s fictionalizing influence; he even falls in love with a beautiful waitress. But Paul&#39;s plan is not what it seems--and neither is Claude&#39;s employer, the Investment Bank of Torabundo, which swells through dodgy takeovers and derivatives trading until--well, you can probably guess how that shakes out.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Mark and the Void&lt;/i&gt; is the funniest novel ever written about the recent financial crisis, and a stirring examination of the deceptions carried out in the names of art and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;" />
