  <title>I Capture the Castle - Dodie Smith, Jenny Han</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Every time I meet someone who also loves &lt;i&gt;I Capture the Castle&lt;/i&gt;, I know we must be kindred spirits.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;from the new foreword by Jenny Han, the&lt;/i&gt; New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author of&lt;/i&gt; To All the Boys I&#39;ve Loved Before&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautiful, deluxe edition of Dodie Smith&#39;s beloved novel, &lt;i&gt;I Capture the Castle&lt;/i&gt;, featuring a new foreword by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jenny Han, a stunning new cover, and designed endpapers that is perfect for devoted readers and those discovering this timeless story for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that&#39;s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn&#39;t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through Cassandra&#39;s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle&#39;s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has &quot;captured the castle&quot; - and the heart of the reader - in one of literature&#39;s most enchanting novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I&#39;ve ever met.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;J.K. Rowling, bestselling author of the Harry Potter series&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
