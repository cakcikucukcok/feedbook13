  <title>Partners in Time #4: Family Matters - Kristen Sheley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When fifteen-year-old Sam Foster finds out that his mother is going to get remarried, his first reaction is shock. His next reaction is thinking that with the help of his time machine, he might be able to go back and prevent his parents from getting divorced in the first place.&lt;p&gt;
When Sam recruits Meg Clayton, his friend from 1850, he finds her missing her extended family and friends in Boston. Meg is quick to agree to Sam&#39;s request for help, not telling him how much she wishes she could fix something in her own life   and that she has her own plans for change.&lt;p&gt;
In this fourth book in the &lt;i&gt;Partners in Time&lt;/i&gt; series, Sam and Meg attempt to manipulate his family history   but it soon becomes apparent that repairing a fractured relationship is extremely complicated. Each time they make a change, it results in a present world that is nothing like Sam ever dreamed-or desired.&lt;p&gt; 
Will they ever be successful in fixing the past and mending the present? Or will Sam never be able to return home again?" />
