  <title>Get rid of your emotional garbage - Stéphane Jalbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People come to me and ask how they can love themselves more, how they can feel good about themselves or simply how to feel better, happier. What I always answer is that they need to get rid of their fears. According to the way I see things, there are actually two driving forces in life: Fear and Love.
The way I work with my clients is that I do not encourage them to build up their courage. At least, not as a long term solution. Instead, I teach them how to let go of these emotions, how to transform them.
Often, fear of other people&#39;s judgment, sadness, anxiety are but symptoms of a much more profound suffering. If you find yourself over eating, smoking, exercising, doing chores, working late, needing a drink and so on so that you can avoid feeling bad, you may want to reconsider your strategy.
I&#39;m sure that like me, you&#39;ve read numerous books, watched hours of videos and maybe even went to events and workshops where great people tell you that you only need to make a shift in your thoughts, that you need to align your desires with the Universe or simply that you need to feel good right now so that you can attract the money, the true love or the healing you so desire.
But, admit it. You didn&#39;t yet get the results you were promised, am I right? That&#39;s because there is a key ingredient that they are not talking about. You need to get rid of your negative emotions and there is a simple technique that you will learn in this book. 
If you are the type of person who doesn&#39;t like to read, or you just don&#39;t have the time, you will love this book. It&#39;s been written in a way that is just for you. 
Straight to the point.
No long chapters that go on forever, no big words to sound important, just the plain facts, the information you need to know. No more, no less. 
Read the book, do the exercises, get rid of your emotional garbage. 
That&#39;s it!" />
