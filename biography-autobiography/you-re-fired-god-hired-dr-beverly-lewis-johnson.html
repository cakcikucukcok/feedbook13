  <title>You’Re Fired, God Hired - Dr. Beverly Lewis-Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, You&#39;re Fired, God Hired is my own true personal story and Journal full of negative experiences sex, race, religion, finances, health and education. This book also features the positive blueprint and journal of my life from Child-hood to Adult-hood. Growning up with a father who was diagnosed as a paranoid catatonic schizophrenic to shattered dreams of becoming the first female Afican-American Land Surveyor in the State of Michigan.
These experiences left scars that would last a lifetime of searching for happiness in drugs, alcohol, sex and a career. Only to find Gods amazing provision in Forgiveness. Being fired by the X-Mayor who made history from his election in the City of Detroit, while I was trying to make history in Mich igan.
This book weaves In and Out of my life as we move from chapter to chapter journaling daily about life choices. Find out in You&#39;re Fired, God Hired how forgiveness and obedience is the keys to healing our lifetime pursuits to find happiness In God. This book is for readers who have had to overcome differences, decisions and devastations from compound losses with man and positive experiences with God.
A great book for healing through forgiveness and Salvation, when you are fired by man and hired by God." />
