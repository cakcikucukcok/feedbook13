  <title>Contradictions of Democracy - Nicholas Rush Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite being one of the world&#39;s most vibrant democracies, police estimate between five and ten percent of the murders in South Africa result from vigilante violence. This is puzzling given the country&#39;s celebrated transition to democracy and massive reform of the state&#39;s legal institutions. Where most studies explain vigilantism as a response to state or civic failure, in &lt;em&gt;Contradictions of Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, Nicholas Rush Smith illustrates that vigilantism is actually a response to the processes of democratic state formation. In the context of densely networked neighborhoods, vigilante citizens often interpret the technical success of legal institutions-for instance, the arrest and subsequent release of suspects on bail-as failure and work to correct such perceived failures on their own. Smith also shows that vigilantism provides a new lens through which to understand democratic state formation. Among young men of color in some parts of South Africa, fear of extra-judicial police violence is common. Amid such fear, instead of the state seeming protective, it can appear as something akin to a massive vigilante organization. An insightful look into the high rates of vigilantism in South Africa and the general challenges of democratic state building, &lt;em&gt;Contradictions of Democracy&lt;/em&gt; explores fundamental questions about political order, the rule of law, and democratic citizenship." />
