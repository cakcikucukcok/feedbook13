He picked his victim at random and stalked her silently, taking pleasure in a game of pretend until he captured his prey, played out his sick fantasies, and reached his ultimate passion watching her die.  Then it was time to choose his next pretty woman.Now Galvin is dying in prison and he&#39;s chosen newspaperman Joe Dougherty to hear the shocking story he never revealed.  Galvin&#39;s deadly game of make-believe was not his alone, but the brainchild of a group of wealthy college friends -- thrill seekers who killed for fun, kept their sickening secret, and went on to live successful, prominent lives.
