  <title>Home Sweet Home - Albert del Toral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A magazine editor and newspaper reporter in Miami, award-winning Cuban-American poet Albert del Toral becomes an emotional rollercoaster in his newest release, which manages to engulf the reader in everything from deeply personal home-life accounts to a taboo-tackling journey of sorts. The author has been getting published since the age of 13, when the &lt;i&gt;Anthology of Poetry by Young Americans&lt;/I&gt; published a poem of his that had been named best in its class. Eleven years later, he&#39;s become an established journalist with releases in two languages, distribution spanning five continents and several awards to his credit. Having previously written for newspapers, magazines, blogs, press releases, websites, newsletters and poetry anthologies, this is the writer&#39;s first foray into book writing.
