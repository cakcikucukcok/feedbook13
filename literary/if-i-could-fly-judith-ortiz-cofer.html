  <title>If I Could Fly - Judith Ortiz Cofer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I Could Fly&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone novel based on characters &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;introduced&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; in Judith Ortiz Cofer&#39;s bestselling short story collection, &lt;i&gt;An Island Like You: Stories of the Barrio&lt;/i&gt;, which won the inaugural Pura Belpré Award.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Doris is used to taking care of herself. Her musician parents have always spent more time singing in nightclubs than watching after her. But when her ailing mother goes home to Puerto Rico to get well and pursue a singing career there, and her father finds a new girlfriend, Doris is more alone than she&#39;s ever been. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disconnected from her family and her best friends, who are intertwined in terrifying relationships with a violent classmate, Doris finds refuge in taking care of homing pigeons on her apartment building&#39;s roof. As Doris tries to make sense of it all, she learns that, just like the pigeons, she might have to fly far distances before she finds out where she belongs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
