  <title>Man and Woman, One in Christ - Philip Barton Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does Paul teach a hierarchy of authority of man over woman, or does he teach the full equality of man and woman in the church and home? In &lt;em&gt;Man and Woman, One in Christ&lt;/em&gt;, Philip Barton Payne answers this question and more, injecting crucial insights into the discussion of Paul&amp;rsquo;s view of women. Condensing over three decades of research on this topic, Payne&amp;rsquo;s rigorous exegetical analysis demonstrates the consistency of Paul&amp;rsquo;s message on this topic and its coherence with the rest of his theology. Payne&amp;rsquo;s exegetical examination of the Pauline corpus is thorough, exploring the influences on Paul, his practice as a church leader, and his teachings to various Christian communities. Paul&amp;rsquo;s theology, instruction, and practice consistently affirm the equal standing of men and women, with profound implications for the church today. &lt;em&gt;Man and Woman, One in Christ&lt;/em&gt; is required reading for all who desire to understand the meaning of Paul&amp;rsquo;s statements regarding women and their relevance for Christian relationships and ministry today. This work has the potential of uniting the church on this contentious issue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
