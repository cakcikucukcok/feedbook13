  <title>In a Time of War - Jr. Bill Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dramatic story of West Point&#39;s class of 2002, the first in a generation to graduate during wartime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They came to West Point in a time of peace, but soon after the start of their senior year, their lives were transformed by September 11. The following June, when President George W. Bush spoke at their commencement and declared that America would &quot;take the battle to the enemy,&quot; the men and women in the class of 2002 understood that they would be fighting on the front lines. In this stirring account of the five years following their graduation from West Point, the class experiences firsthand both the rewards and the costs of leading soldiers in the war on terror. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a Time of War &lt;/i&gt;focuses on two members of the class of 2002 in particular: Todd Bryant, an amiable, funny Californian for whom military service was a family tradition; and Drew Sloan, the hardworking son of liberal parents from Arkansas who is determined to serve his country. On the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, Todd, Drew, and their classmates--the army&#39;s newest and youngest officers--lead their troops into harm&#39;s way again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meticulously reported, sweeping in scope, Bill Murphy Jr.&#39;s powerful book follows these brave and idealistic officers--and their families--as they experience the harrowing reality of the modern battlefield. &lt;i&gt;In a Time of War &lt;/i&gt;tells a vivid and sometimes heartbreaking story about courage, honor, and what war really means to the soldiers whose lives it defines.&lt;/p&gt;" />
