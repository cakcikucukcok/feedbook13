  <title>Eye Soar&#39;s Trials... Tribulations... &amp; Blessed Treasures - David L. Slaughter Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having been inspired by dreams, ideas, entertainment, history, fiction and non-fiction, and so much more in life, Eye Soars Trials... Tribulations... &amp; Blessed Treasures is a culmination of poems that have been written over a number of years by David L. Slaughter II. As such, you will find poems that deal with military and war (whether on the broad spectrum or from an individual perspective), political stances, love of family, faith in God, dreams, fears and anxieties, as well as lighthearted poems that still possess a message in their own right.
Of course, not all the poems contained within are based on what has inspired David, but also to inspire others to overcome their own demons, problems, self-esteem issues, concerns, etc. with the hope that the reader, whether reading those that have inspired or to inspire will gain a perspective for themselves to relate to. If we find relation in our own lives by the words of another, we also find we learn and grow." />
