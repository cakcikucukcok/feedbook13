  <title>Lost Memories - Helen Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;No one ever said that life was easy or fair to everyone. But always remember that with a few simple words that are written or spoken well let your pain and let tears flow.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When your feeling angry or frustrated or just feeling alone may the thoughts you feel flow onto paper and the words rise up and allow yourself time to feel. And no matter what happens youll always have you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My book that I have written is about poetry and short stories of my thoughts, feelings and my pain. I just let my feelings fl ow onto the paper and the words just write themselves.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My poetry that is written onto paper is all mine. And I hope for whoever reads my book of poetry can feel the emotion that I have when it was written. For in life there are many ups and downs and sometimes it may feel that sadness is all around and sometimes life is not easy or even fair and thats why I think that in hard times.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All we ever really need to do is read a perfect poem that matches our mood at the time to bring a smile to our face.&lt;/P&gt;" />
