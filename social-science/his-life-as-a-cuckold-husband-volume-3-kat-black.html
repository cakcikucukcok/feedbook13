  <title>His Life As a Cuckold Husband Volume 3 - Kat Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the doorbell is ringing, Kim stands up and pulls out a blindfold and walks over to Jake and ties the blindfold around his eyes.     &quot;What&#39;s this about?&quot; Jake asks.    She leads him to the bathroom and before she closes the door, she tells him to stay inside while she gets things ready. She tells him that she will be back for him and to leave the blindfold on. Then Kim closes the bathroom door and walks away. Jake is wondering what in the hell is going on. She said that there was something going on tonight, but she failed to give him any details. His curiosity was piqued and he was a bit nervous as well.    A few moments later, Kim opens the bathroom door then closes it again, while standing inside. &quot;Strip off all your clothes, except for your panties and bra.&quot; She orders him. Jake complies and strips. Seems like he&#39;s been doing a lot of that lately. Stripping his clothes off, that is. But, nonetheless, he does what she says." />
