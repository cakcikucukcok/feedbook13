  <title>A Possibility of Violence - D. A. Mishani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haunted by the past and his own limitations, Israeli Detective Avraham Avraham must stop a criminal ruthless enough to target children in this evocative and gripping tale of mystery and psychological suspense that is the follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Missing File&lt;/em&gt;, the acclaimed first novel in D. A. Mishani&amp;#8217;s literary crime series that was shortlisted for the CWA International Dagger Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explosive device is found in a suitcase near a daycare center in a quiet suburb of Tel Aviv. A few hours later, a threat is received: the suitcase was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Avraham Avraham, back in Israel after a much-needed vacation, is assigned to the investigation. Tormented by the trauma and failure of his past case, Avraham is determined not to make the same mistakes&amp;#8212;especially with innocent lives at stake. He may have a break when one of the suspects, a father of two, appears to have gone on the run. Is he the terrorist behind the threat? Is he trying to escape Avraham&amp;#8217;s intense investigation? Or perhaps he&amp;#8217;s fleeing a far more terrible crime that no one knows has been committed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much Avraham wants to atone for the past, redemption may not be possible&amp;#8212;not when he&amp;#8217;s entangled in a case more deceptive and abominable than any he&amp;#8217;s ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;" />
