  <title>Poetry from Spirit - Myra J McPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book of poetry is somewhat special. I can only tell you how it came to be, and that I am only the messenger. There is much more poetry waiting to be written. I have no idea what that is at the moment, and words will only return when this project is underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first poem in this book, A Child Is Born, should make everyone think of their own role in this life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Am will hopefully help you understand exactly what you are and how little respect and understanding you hold for your own heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People Watcher came from an entity, not physical, and haunted me in a very puzzling way, for days as I recognized various things about myself and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something to learn, or more correctly to remember, in every poem. There is one knocking on my door at this moment that needs me to explain the balance of this world of ours, but that is for another day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the words printed here and that they light a few lights of understanding; that they may help to show you another way to make your life full of love and joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to live with as few rules as possible and keep those rules clean. Firstly, the very old and trusted Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Also to be kind. Remember that today is all you have. And finally love is all there is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone love in your hearts, peace in your minds and true joy in your lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
