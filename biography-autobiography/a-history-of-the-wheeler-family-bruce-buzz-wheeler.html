  <title>A History of the Wheeler Family - Bruce &quot;Buzz&quot; Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the past 20+ years, Buzz Wheeler treasured an original volume of his family history compiled by his father and another family member, Bill, that chronicled Wheeler history in America up until 1994. But a lot has happened in the lives of the Wheelers since that original volume was published.&amp;nbsp;The Wheelers are now scattered all over the country, living out their own versions of love and achievement. Buzz has enjoyed hearing of the lives and accomplishments of his extended family members through the years, and he can&amp;rsquo;t help but smile when he thinks of his hardworking grandparents taking a risk on that first Wheeler&amp;rsquo;s store. He has often wondered, &lt;em&gt;What would they think if they could see how their legacy has impacted so many generations?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the family&amp;rsquo;s success and mobility comes at a cost, which is the loss of their stories, so Buzz felt that it was time to reclaim and restore that rich legacy. &lt;em&gt;A History of the Wheeler Family&lt;/em&gt; is an update of the original book that includes the happenings of the last two decades. Along the way, additional memories of days gone by have been collected and added to this volume as well. The result is a compilation that every Wheeler is sure to enjoy, allowing each family member to share these stories with their children and grandchildren.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
