  <title>Great Grandma&#39;s Guidelines to Prevent Childhood Accidents - Florence Parry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to bring about a general community awareness of          ALREADY KNOWN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS  and PRECAUTIONS that can be taken to prevent the constant re-occurrence of PREDICTABLE childhood accidents that occur to children aged  from 0 to 14 years of age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PREVENTION is BETTER than CURE     -      SOMETIMES there is  NO CURE	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When a baby is born, the parents are not magically bestowed with all the knowledge and skills of  child rearing.  This has to be learned.	&lt;br&gt;
NOT the HARD WAY by TRIAL and ERROR     &lt;br&gt;   
Rearing children in such a way can lead to a child having to pay a very high price for his learning experience and the Carer at the time of the accident become deeply affected by feelings of regret and sorrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It makes more sense for parents to FIND OUT BEFORE rather than AFTER   an accident  has occurred the  precautions they could have taken. IF ONLY THEY HAD  KNOWN." />
