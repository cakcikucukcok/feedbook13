  <title>Children at the Gate - Benjamin  Pressley Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children at the Gate is set in San Francisco during the 1970&#39;s and 80&#39;s. The story is about a group of young people from diverse backgrounds who are seeking meaning and direction during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. This includes the end of the Vietnam War, the resignation of Richard Nixon, the rise of black militant groups, the resurgence of the feminist movement, and the emergence of AIDS.   Travis Carter is a Vietnam vet who falls in love with a talented young woman named Marcella Morgan, who makes her living as a mime on the streets of San Francisco and aspires to be an actress. Travis&#39; best friend is a fellow Vietnam vet who is down on his luck and joins a militant black group bent on revolution. Travis himself has no particular ambition, but is fed up with war and violence. He eventually finds his calling, but not before being drawn into worlds with which he is unfamiliar but must deal with." />
