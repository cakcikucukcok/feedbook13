  <title>Just Life - Neil Abramson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Neil Abramson, &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Unsaid&lt;/i&gt;, comes a riveting novel that explores the complex connection between humans and animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veterinarian Samantha Lewis and her team are dedicated to providing a sanctuary for unwanted, abused, and abandoned dogs in New York City. But every day it gets harder to operate her no-kill shelter. Sam is already at her breaking point when she learns of an unidentified, dangerous virus spreading through their neighborhood. The medical community can only determine that animals are the carriers. Amid growing panic and a demand for immediate answers, suspicion abruptly falls on dogs as the source. Soon the governor is calling in the National Guard to enforce a quarantine--no dog may leave the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha knows from her own painful history that, despite the lack of real evidence against the dogs, a quarantine may only be the beginning. As questions about the source of the virus mount and clash with the pressure for a politically expedient resolution, Sam is forced to make life-altering choices. She finds allies in a motley crew of New Yorkers--a local priest, a troubled teen, a smart-mouthed former psychologist, and a cop desperate to do the right thing--all looking for sanctuary from their own personal demons. But the person Sam needs the most to unravel the mystery of the virus and save the dogs is the last one she&#39;d ever want to call on--because contacting him will mean confronting the traumatic past she has fought so hard to escape." />
