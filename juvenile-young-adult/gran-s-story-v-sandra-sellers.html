  <title>Gran’S Story V - Sandra Sellers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now, Reader,we are almost  to the end of our visit with Roxanne and Floyd.  Will you miss them?  I expect I will see them in my dreams, or I will think &quot;that couple there----no that one----certainly  the ones I saw yesterday---&quot;  are the beautiful O&#39;Malleys.  Will we see them in celebrity magazines? Be  looking.   (part  2)Roxanne first appeared as laughing and carefree.  She was a spoiled and pampered child in silk dresses with a seamstress all her own.  She could eat anything she wanted and refused to do lessons.  She would pout to get her way.  (part 3) Floyd Ray appeared as one of the wild O&#39;Malley clan.  He beats up prissy Eugen in a mountain-like defense of kinfolk.  He throws dangerously-sharp knives.  BUT hes as brave and brilliant as Roxanne, beneath the laughter, is insecure.  We see her lying in a heap in the nurse&#39;s office after eating pockets full of candy and again in &quot;Gran III&quot; when her costume is almost ripped away. Both events destroy more of her self esteem.  In &quot;Gran IV, we see her fear of woods and her adoration of Floyd who always befriends and rescues her. Does his kindness produce an effect on Roxanne?  We&#39;ll see.  (part 4)  In book V, Reader,  all characters and events meet and blend:  (1) Roxanne helps Floyd with the orchids, running all over the place and eating apples. (2)  Roxanne leaves tearfully for Europe (She &quot;just hates&quot; it!&quot;).   There&#39;s nothing fit to eat in Europe.  Snails and kidneys? Really now!(3) She sees her parents are  hurt.(4)  She grows up and shows her love for them. (5)  She realizes when she returns home that her best friend is her true love.  What happened after that, Reader?  It&#39;s up to you to find out!    &quot;Bye, now.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
Is there a happy ending?&lt;p&gt;" />
