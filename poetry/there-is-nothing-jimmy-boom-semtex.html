  <title>There Is Nothing - Jimmy Boom Semtex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is Jimmy Boom Semtex&#39;s new book. The poems and prose for adults here is unique, explosive and funny in equal measure. The usual suspects are covered: evil war, doing trashy jobs, death, surreal views, exotic women and much more. Check out Jimmy&#39;s poems. Watch out for his future releases. The future is explosive!  An example is: Hunter Becomes the Hunted World War 2 is still relevant in 2014. Widow of a Kriegsmarine Captain&#39;s U-boat still misses her husband. How she wishes he&#39;d had a shore posting and not gone to sea. When he died in his steel coffin, he left a wife and a child. His last resting place is now known off the Cornish coast with two other subs." />
