  <title>Cursed in the Blood - Sharan Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The fifth in Sharan Newman&#39;s highly authentic and richly praised series, &lt;i&gt;Cursed in the Blood&lt;/i&gt; finds Catherine LeVendeur venturing to the cold and tumultuous homeland of her husband--only to realize that vast differences between Edgar&#39;s family and her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After making the pilgrimage to Compostela and giving birth to a son, Catherine LeVendeur is looking forward to an idyllic life at home in Paris. Yet her contentment is shattered when she and Edgar receive news from his family: Edgar&#39;s two oldest brothers have been ambushed and murdered, and he must return to Scotland to help avenge their deaths. At first, Edgar refuses to go, knowing what may await them in his war torn homeland. But Catherine believes in family loyalty and insists upon accompanying him with their baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in Scotland, Catherine is surprised to learn that Edger&#39;s family is not what she imagined: His father, Waldeve, is a cold tyrant, and his remaining siblings are distant and secretive. Separated from Edgar during their efforts to uncover the truth, Catherine is expelled from his family&#39;s care. She becomes a stranger in a strange land, searching for refuge in a country ravaged by civil war at the same time she searches for her husband. Yet she knows that any haven she finds will only be temporary until she answers this question: Who among Waldeve&#39;s enemies hates his passionately enough to destroy his whole family--including, she fears, his infant grandson?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
