          &lt;strong&gt;She Needed a Place To Call Home&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beth Anderson was pregnant and had nowhere to turn–until handsome, and much older, lawyer David Matthews offered her a warm place to stay for the night, no strings attached. But a well-meaning matchmaker saw the spark between them and resolved to make Beth&#39;s visit more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He Needed Someone To Love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;David was indeed attracted to his new houseguest, but thought their age difference too great. Even though Beth seemed wise beyond her years, David just couldn&#39;t get past the number. But kissing her was a temptation he could not resist–and losing her was a chance he was not willing to take…!&lt;/p&gt;

I like for the age difference to be at least 10 years in these sort of romances, and in this book, the hero is 40, and the heroine is 25, so that's a nice 15 yr age difference. And in this book the hero is about to celebrate the big 4-0.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>To Love An Older Man (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Debbi Rawlins</a> </h3></p><hr/>
