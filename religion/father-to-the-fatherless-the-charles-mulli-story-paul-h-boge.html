  <title>Father to the Fatherless: The Charles Mulli Story - Paul H Boge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six-year-old Charles Mulli wakes up in his Kenyan hut to discover his parents have abandoned him. Forced to beg from hut to hut in search of food, Charles scrapes out a meagre existence while trying to come to terms with his abusive past and seemingly hopeless future. As a teenager, Charles is invited by a friend to a crusade where he commits his life to Christ. That act begins a unique adventure of faith, miracles, and a passion for reaching street children. After years of struggle, Charles experiences unprecedented success. He finds a wonderful wife, raises a family, excels in business to such a degree that he creates an empire that is noticed by the President of Kenya. Charles becomes a pinnacle in the Church movement, but then his life changes again. In spite of his tremendous achievements, the plight of the growing street children problem in his country remains strong in Charles&#39; heart. He is unable to shut out their cries, the cries he understands so well, and he realizes he must respond. Convicted by God to give away all his possessions, Charles sells everything to pursue his passion of rescuing street children from the slums of Kenya. He battles against corrupt religious establishments, supernatural enemies, and intense financial pressures to bring hope to those whose lives reflect his own childhood. Mully Children&#39;s Family (MCF) Orphanage was founded and established by Charles and Esther Mulli in response to the desperate needs of street children, abandoned children, and HIV/AIDS orphans in Kenya in 1989. Father to the Fatherless is the true story of a man whose life begins in desperate poverty, moves to riches, and finally servanthood, where he becomes a real-life demonstration of selfless love and sacrifice that challenges us to evaluate the cost of giving up all to God in the service of others." />
