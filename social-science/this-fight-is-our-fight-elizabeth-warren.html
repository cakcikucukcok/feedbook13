  <title>This Fight Is Our Fight - Elizabeth Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1 New York Times bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fiery U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and bestselling  author offers a passionate, inspiring book about why our middle class is  under siege and how we can win the fight to save it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren has long been an outspoken champion of  America&#39;s middle class, and by the time the people of Massachusetts  elected her in 2012, she had become one of the country&#39;s leading  progressive voices. Now, at a perilous moment for our nation, she has  written a book that is at once an illuminating account of how we built  the strongest middle class in history, a scathing indictment of those  who have spent the past thirty-five years undermining working families,  and a rousing call to action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren grew up in Oklahoma, and she&#39;s never forgotten how difficult  it was for her mother and father to hold on at the ragged edge of the  middle class. An educational system that offered opportunities for all  made it possible for her to achieve her dream of going to college,  becoming a teacher, and, later, attending law school. But now, for many,  these kinds of opportunities are gone, and a government that once  looked out for working families is instead captive to the rich and  powerful. Seventy-five years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt and his  New Deal ushered in an age of widespread prosperity; in the 1980s,  President Ronald Reagan reversed course and sold the country on the  disastrous fiction called trickle-down economics. Now, with the election  of Donald Trump--a con artist who promised to drain the swamp of special  interests and then surrounded himself with billionaires and  lobbyists--the middle class is being pushed ever closer to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in the candid, high-spirited voice that is Warren&#39;s trademark, &lt;i&gt;This Fight Is Our Fight&lt;/i&gt;  tells eye-opening stories about her battles in the Senate and vividly  describes the experiences of hard-working Americans who have too often  been given the short end of the stick. Elizabeth Warren has had enough  of phony promises and a government that no longer serves its people--she  won&#39;t sit down, she won&#39;t be silenced, and she &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; fight back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
