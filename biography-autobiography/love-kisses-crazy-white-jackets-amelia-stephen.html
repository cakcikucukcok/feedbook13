  <title>Love, Kisses, &amp; Crazy White Jackets - Amelia Stephen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not everyone meets their soul mate in their lifetime, but nobody expects to meet their soul mate when theyre in the formative teen years. Growing up feeling invisible, Amelia meets a boy who sees her and makes her feel visible and special. From the first moment she looked into his eyes, she saw a confused, sad, and chaotic soul, yet she had a peaceful acceptance of it. 
He soon becomes aggressive toward her, but she doesnt want to give up. Loving him felt right, but she found that staying with him was wrong. The pain of having to let go of the one soul who made her visible and whom she would forever feel connected to forever was a heart-wrenching decision she had to make. 
Years later, she receives a letter that doesnt excuse his actions but helps her understand why his soul was so sad, confused, and chaotic." />
