  <title>Names in the Sand - Carla Swarner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An incurable tomboy, Rose Stanton faces unforeseen struggles as the Civil War rages all around her. She scorns the ladies finishing school she is sent to in New Orleans, feeling that she should be able to help in the conflict. To make matters worse, her best friend Mark had joined the Confederate army, and left before she could clear up a misunderstanding that could destroy their friendship forever. When her twin sister Diana vanishes after they have an intense argument, Rose is left to wonder if she will ever see her again. A series of unexpected events lands Rose in a Union prison accused of treason. Rose has always been a strong Christian, but will her faith be able to withstand the tests before her now? Will she ever see her loved ones again? And will Diana ever find the peace she is searching for?&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Mark Corrigan suddenly finds his lifelong friend is growing into a lovely young woman, but he has not trusted any woman since his mother left him as a child. Can he trust the changes he sees in Rose? Struggling with uncertainty over their friendship, he faces additional difficulties as he heads off to battle. A change in military plans will put his life in even more danger and cause his brother, Joel, to make a serious mistake. Even his friends believe he has betrayed them. With his own life being threatened, and his brother missing, Mark finds the only one he has left to turn to is God. Will the truth of what he has been assigned to do ever be uncovered? Will the war cost him everything he has ever cared about?&lt;/p&gt;" />
