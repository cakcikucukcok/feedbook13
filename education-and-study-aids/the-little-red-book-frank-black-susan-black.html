  <title>The Little Red Book - Frank Black, Susan Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Susan and Frank Black provide you with their discovery about teaching English as a second language in China - mainly that communism is alive and well structured in the classroom and that&#39;s a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classroom structure is something that anyone planning to teach in China, and everyone who is already doing it, should know about. Even the best designed lesson plan will not play if your students are not recognized for who they are: duty-driven, study-driven citizens of their Motherland.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another critical fact revealed is contained in the chapter: &#39;Who&#39;s Who in the Chinese Classroom?&#39;. You will learn the truth about the classroom Monitor and about his or her duty to serve you, the Foreign Expert. There are many students ready to assist you in the classroom and this book reveals who they are and how they can be of help to you. The chapter on &#39;Teaching Group Work in China&#39; lays out a first-of-its-kind real-life lesson plan for both skeptics and adventurous types.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All the characters in this book are real, and any resemblance to real persons, living or dead is not coincidental. You will meet &#39;Midnight Runners&#39; who sneak off into the night and Chinese English teachers who wish they could. You&#39;ll meet students who have a profound feeling of duty to their teachers and other students who don&#39;t. You will discover what some students believe about learning English as a second language and how their motives can help you facilitate a great class. &lt;b&gt;The Little Red Book Teaching ESL in China&lt;/b&gt; is your official guide.
