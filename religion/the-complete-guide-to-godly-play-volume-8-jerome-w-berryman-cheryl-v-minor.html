  <title>The Complete Guide to Godly Play: Volume 8 - Jerome W. Berryman, Cheryl V. Minor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The eight volumes of Godly Play invite children from ages 3 to 12 (and beyond) to enter into a deeper and more spontaneous and playful relationship with God. Based on the Montessori method, Godly Play uses a purposeful telling of lessons and stories, engaging storytelling materials and the community of children themselves to encourage participants to seek and find their own answers to their faith questions.   This unique approach to religious education invites children to wonder about themselves, God and the world in a way that is both playful and meaningful. Godly Play is really a practice of spiritual guidance because it respects the innate spirituality of children and encourages them to use their own curiosity and imagination to experience deeply the joy and mystery of God.   Volume 8 of The Complete Guide to Godly Play includes the following new lessons: • The Greatest Parable  • Jesus and Jerusalem: The Story of Holy Week • Mary, the Mother of Jesus • Knowing Jesus in a New Way  • The Church • The Liturgical Synthesis    It also includes a wealth of capstone insights gleaned from decades of research and practice, as well as an appendix summarizing the foundational literature and describing the entirety of the Godly Play spiral curriculum as it exists today." />
