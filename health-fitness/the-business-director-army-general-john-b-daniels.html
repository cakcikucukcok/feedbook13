  <title>The Business Director-Army General - John B. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I own up. My greatest fantasy is to look at things in the light of others. These things may not be identical, complementing, or overly related. I believe to do a comparison or two is quite enlightening; it keeps the mind alert and focused all the time. That is the sharpness I encourage in the business practice of today to become a multimillionaire. When am on the highway and a sleek, smart car zooms past, I do not hesitate to cut short whatever conversation to comment to my travel mate, What a cute car! Isnt the finish deadly, the color superb? I would be smiling the moment he retorts, Its cool, deadly, marvelous! Then I look back via the side mirror only to see a better-looking limousine overtaking.
This is the greatness of the immeasurable mans ability going all the way, utilizing all the intellect and resources to come up with a superb product.
Though it may sound quite awkward, I strongly advocate for giving credit where it deserves. No harm in that. To wonder whether that car five
minutes ago was American, English, or Japanese made would assure I do
not doze behind the steering." />
