  <title>Pomes a Wry Look at Life and Everything - Thad Sherman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is 150 pages crammed with eighty four pomes presented in an easily readable style. Short titles have been chosen so that the plot and punch line are not always immediately obvious.
Pomes are a reflection of everyday life and happenings with a wry twist.
The subjects vary widely and randomly, the only consistent theme is that all except the first three are in alphabetical order.
No two pomes cover the same subject although The Fantasies and The Ponderer are close but different. Some are based on Thads early life in London while others derive from living close to the countryside in later life. A few touch on solutions to insoluble problems but only in a light hearted manner, for example The Roads. The only pome with a message is The Time. There is of course the odd cheeky pome and romantic pome to cover as much of lifes spectrum as possible. Some of the pomes relate true happenings and it could be fun to try to pick them outThe rest are pure imagination.
	The title Pomes is a legacy from my late sister Eileen who was an absolute wizard at advertising rhymes and jingles she called Pomes. So in some way this book is a late tribute to Eileen; if I have only been half as good as Eileen then hopefully you will enjoy these pomes as much as I have enjoyed writing them. In all honesty I cannot offer a money back guarantee since tastes will differ.But I just offer you this thought.
As an engineer I have a very practical and logical mind, but I can assure you I have witnessed poltergeists in action. My aunt was a psychic medium and called me a reincarnate. I try hard to keep an open mind about everything, but I believe my sister has in some way guided
me while writing the verses. I know what I think, I do not ask you to believe it. I have to ask myself why this sudden urge to write pomes and all written within six months and never before have I written a pome, poem, or verse. (Spooky Eh?)" />
