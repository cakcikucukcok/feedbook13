  <title>Dark Night and Brighter Days - Kent Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WARNING! &lt;br&gt;
ACHTUNG!&lt;br&gt;
OPASNO!&lt;br&gt;
This little book may be hazardous to your mental, spiritual, and/or physical health. If the author&#39;s measure is any gauge than it will almost certainly be hazardous to your financial health. No portion of this book should be taken as any type of advice, legal or otherwise. This book is merely the out loud musings of a Southern Man* with a southern heart from a U.S. Southern State, at the early part of the 21st century.  Any similarities of any individuals are accurately attributable to the fact that we are all human beings, at least in theory, and therefore we all share similar experiences.
It is NOT my objective to be cute
nor is my objective to convince you
or win you, or flatter you, or anything to you.
It IS my objective to express myself
as clearly, as honestly, as precise as I am capable.
For as three comes before 4or score and seven years ago, our forefathers
hung their harps on the willows and cried for Babylon. 
And with quills like chisels carved on the snarling face of time these words:
Hello . . . . I love you . . . .
wont you tell me your name?" />
