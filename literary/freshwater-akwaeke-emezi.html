  <title>Freshwater - Akwaeke Emezi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An extraordinary debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; explores the surreal experience of having a fractured self. It centers around a young Nigerian woman, Ada, who develops separate selves within her as a result of being born “with one foot on the other side.” Unsettling, heartwrenching, dark, and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp evocation of a rare way of experiencing the world, one that illuminates how we all construct our identities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ada begins her life in the south of Nigeria as a troubled baby and a source of deep concern to her family. Her parents, Saul and Saachi, successfully prayed her into existence, but as she grows into a volatile and splintered child, it becomes clear that something went terribly awry. When Ada comes of age and moves to America for college, the group of selves within her grows in power and agency. A traumatic assault leads to a crystallization of her alternate selves: As?ghara and Saint Vincent. As Ada fades into the background of her own mind and these selves—now protective, now hedonistic—move into control, Ada’s life spirals in a dark and dangerous direction.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Told from the perspective of the various selves within Ada, and closely based on the author’s own personal experiences, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; explores the metaphysics of identity and mental health, plunging the reader into the mystery of being and self. &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; dazzles with ferocious energy and serpentine grace, heralding the arrival of a fierce new literary voice." />
