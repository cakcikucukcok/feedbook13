  <title>Let the Good Prevail - Logan Miller, Noah Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Small-town boys Caleb and Jake Boyd spend their days splitting logs and barely scraping by in the badlands of New Mexico. Caleb, a decorated war hero, wants to put his fighting days behind him, find a decent job, and start a quiet life with his new fianc&amp;#233;. But brother Jake is always dreaming bigger than he should, and when he stumbles across a large crop of marijuana hidden in the wilderness, he thinks he has finally hit the jackpot. It turns out that stealing the harvest is about the worst get-rich-quick scheme Jake has ever had, and before long, the brothers find themselves on a collision course with a vicious drug cartel, its eccentric kingpin (a professional dancer-turned-gangster who walks barefoot among the mesas), and a corrupt, cocaine-addled sheriff (who also happens to be Caleb&amp;#8217;s future father-in-law). Violence and mayhem ensue, hurtling Caleb, alone, on a tragi-comic journey toward an unexpected end.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A gripping, unconventional thriller reminiscent of &lt;I&gt;A History of Violence&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;No Country For Old Men&lt;/I&gt;, but with a voice all its own, &lt;I&gt;Let the Good Prevail&lt;/I&gt; offers a fresh take on the timeless theme of revenge, set amid the harsh beauty, and reality, of the contemporary West. &lt;I&gt;Let the Good Prevail&lt;/I&gt; is the first in a proposed trilogy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;The screen adaptation of &lt;I&gt;Let the Good Prevail&lt;/I&gt; will be the Miller brothers&#39; third feature film, to begin shooting in 2015. Josh Hartnett (&lt;I&gt;Penny Dreadful, Black Hawk Down&lt;/I&gt;) is attached to play the role of Caleb, and Ed Harris is attached to play Sheriff Darius Gates.&lt;/div&gt;" />
