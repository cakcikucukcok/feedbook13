  <title>Going to Ireland - Sherry Irvine, Nora Hickey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a few weeks, a few months, next year, sometime-- you are
      going on a genealogical research trip to Ireland. Success will
      depend upon having names to work with and on some knowledge of
      place and time; progress will be better if some things are done
      before departure. How do you prepare, and do your best to insure
      research time is well spent? Start with this guide. The authors
      have considerable experience in helping genealogists begin their
      research in North America and in guiding them through the steps
      they must take in Ireland.
      &lt;P&gt;The book introduces researchers to Irish boundaries, Irish
      records and Irish repositories. There are suggestions for what
      to do at home, outlines of the contents and services of archives
      and libraires in Ireland, as well as some travel advice. The
      bibliography lists those how-to books and reference works which
      will build understanding and even speed the process. As well
      as being full of useful information, this handy guide is easy
      to take along. Don&#39;t leave home without it!" />
