  <title>Love and Distance - Jose Carlos Rodriguez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vanessa, your name is famous and has many beautiful meanings,
It signifi es the fragrance of roses, and like that fragrance, this letter is for you.
I havent been able to go to you, my love.
How I long to be by your side!
Like a plant wants rain, so do I need you.
Th ese days seem to drag on forever.
How miserable it is to be far from the one you love.
Our feelings have become so strong that you cant hold back the tears.
Th e pain in our hearts is so profound that it seems like an intense drought,
It seems like the plants will never fl ower and their leaves will stay dry.
Oh, my love! How I long to be by your side.
Like the great hunger that people feel, like children you who cry and their mothers, too
Because they have nothing to feed them.
My love! Forgive my handwriting, but my hands are trembling. Please
Also forgive the stains on the paper, they are from the tears that I shed because I cant be with you.
I sigh and moan from the pain.
Oh, my love! When will I be there with you? Time passes on, and I dont know.
How strong are my sighs, how great is my affl iction.
I cant take it anymore, my hands cant even hold the pen that Im writing to you with.
All I can tell you is that I wrote these poems for you.
Enjoy them, my love, because they tell you about my kisses,
As well as my aff ection and everything that I feel for you.
Take all my kisses and receive my aff ection, because Im writing to you with the earnestness
Of a child.
I LOVE YOU! FROM YOUR SWEET HEART, JOSE CARLOS." />
