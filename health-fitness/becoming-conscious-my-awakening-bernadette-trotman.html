  <title>Becoming Conscious - My Awakening - Bernadette Trotman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Becoming Conscious, My Awakening is a true account of my struggles to achieve my personal goal of getting a Green Card for me and my children.  It chronicles my journey from Poverty in British Guyana, to abundance in America.
My Spiritual teachers Jesus, Dr Deepak Chopra and Dr Wayne Dwyer taught me that we are all co-creators of our life.  Life is what you make it. As a man thinketh so is he.  The law of intention and Jesus teaches us that faith, belief and action can allows us to transcend any of life situations by just harnessing the power of our thoughts.  Dr Deepak Chopra teachings about the laws of Synchrodestiny, the study that teaches that every moment is as it should be and that every situation is predestined.  I learned to look for opportunity in every situation. There are no co-incidences. 
My book is a powerful testimony about the Glory of God and harnessing the powers of the Universe to achieve all your goals and desires of the heart.  The coincidence of getting a free ticket to a seminar blossomed into me starting a successful business; the coincidence of me parking my limousine in the church parking lot, transformed into me being saved and washed in the blood of Jesus; the coincidence of me being in the right places at the right times transformed into this story.  This book  is a powerful testament of the statement  What you think about, you bring about It is a powerful testimony of the principle of Jesus teachings on the faith of the mustard seed and if you believe, all things are possible.   So intend to be blessed and inspired and you will be.  If God can do it for me, he can  also do it for you." />
