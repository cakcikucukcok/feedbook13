  <title>Reap a Wicked Harvest - Janis Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In River City, Missouri, the &quot;wedding of the year&quot; is causing florist Bretta Solomon one headache after another. Bretta and a few other River City business owners have been hired by a newcomer to this small Midwestern town to throw an unforgettable party for Evelyn Montgomery&#39;s daughter, and Evelyn wants every lavish detail to be perfectly done. Bretta; Oliver, the landscaper; Sonya, the wedding coordinator; Claire, the beautician; Dana, the caterer; and Kasey, the photographer; are all being driven nuts by Evelyn&#39;s last-minute, over-the-top demands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during the week leading up to the wedding, Bretta&#39;s estranged father shows up for a &quot;surprise&quot; visit and moves himself into her house. And as if these two events alone weren&#39;t enough, the enigmatic Bailey Monroe, a DEA agent Bretta met during a previous adventure, also has arrived in town claiming a desire to get to know her better. It&#39;s shaping up to be quite a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just when she thinks things can&#39;t get any worse, two wedding workers die suspiciously on the same day, and Bretta can&#39;t help but think there&#39;s something more sinister in the air than love and marriage. In &lt;i&gt;Reap a Wicked Harvest&lt;/i&gt;, it&#39;s up to Janis Harrison&#39;s delightfully determined gardening sleuth to figure out just exactly what&#39;s going on before the big day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
