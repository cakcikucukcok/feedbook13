  <title>God&#39;s Secret Agents: Queen Elizabeth&#39;s Forbidden Priests and the Hatching of the Gunpowder Plot - Alice Hogge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One evening in 1588, just weeks after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, two young men landed in secret on a beach in Norfolk, England. They were Jesuit priests, Englishmen, and their aim was to achieve by force of argument what the Armada had failed to do by force of arms: return England to the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years later their mission would be shattered by the actions of the Gunpowder Plotters -- a small group of terrorists who famously tried to destroy the Houses of Parliament -- for the Jesuits were accused of having designed &quot;that most horrid and hellish conspiracy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice Hogge follows &quot;God&#39;s secret agents&quot; from their schooling on the Continent, through their perilous return journeys and lonely lives in hiding, to, ultimately, the gallows. She offers a remarkable true account of faith, duty, intolerance, and martyrdom -- the unforgettable story of men who would die for a cause undone by men who would kill for it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
