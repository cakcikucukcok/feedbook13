  <title>Time-Crunched Triathlon - Joe Beer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time-crunched Triathlon is a manual for life, which will help beginners and experienced triathletes maximize their investment, success and enjoyment in this most demanding of endurance sports. Those with hectic lives who want to enjoy triathlons must ensure that they train effectively. Participating in three sports means trying to be a jack-of-all trades, organizing a lot of equipment and trying to make sense of the huge wealth of training information available both off- and online. This no-nonsense guide provides real-life case studies, clear and simple explanations, and tips and tricks from successful triathletes. It debunks the theory that triathletes are super-beings and looks at the ways they manage training on top of a busy lifestyle. It also considers the usual challenges of weather, illness and injury, and how to be consistent even when you can’t follow a completely regimented routine 24/7. Perfect for any triathlete who wants to become more time-efficient, Joe Beer’s book forgoes the fluff and focuses on the ultimate training essentials." />
