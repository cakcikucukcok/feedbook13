  <title>The Metaphysics of Inspired Communication - Glen Carl Cutlip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Metaphysics of Inspired Communication takes us beyond what communication appears to be. Although one of the dual mind has ears that hear not, this doesnt mean that such a one doesnt hear at all. One of the dual mind has ears that hear not because such hearing is hearing in part, for deafness is a part of such hearing.
Inspired communication is a means of reconciling so-called hearing and deafness so that one may have ears that hear. It is also a means of reconciling sight and blindness so that one may have eyes that see. It is also a means of reconciling life and death so that one may experience the resurrection from the death one is living in.
As we reconcile the opposites of being, we come to realize that deafness is a part of hearing. To deny deafness is to deny the hearing hidden within it. Accordingly, to deny blindness is to deny the sight hidden within it. To deny death is to deny the life hidden within it.
In order to have ears that hear, we must allow deafness to be a part of hearing, for they are revealed to be two parts of the same thing. To have eyes that see, we must allow blindness to be a part of sight, for they are two parts of the same thing. To have life that is beyond what life and death appear to be, we must allow death to be a part of life.
The Metaphysics of Inspired Communication brings unconscious awareness unto conscious awareness so that we may understand how it is that the deaf hear, the blind see, and how the dead are raised. We come to understand that the resurrection of the dead takes place in present time, not after the body passes away; for the resurrection is of the 
living-dead in the first place.
Communicating beyond what communication appears to be to the dual mind is not an easy thing. It is not a difficult thing either, even though it seems to have taken a long time in arriving at this point in consciousness." />
