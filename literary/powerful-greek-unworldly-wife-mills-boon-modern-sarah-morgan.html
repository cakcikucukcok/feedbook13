          &lt;strong&gt;Powerful and proud ; he&#39;s a traditional Greek husband!&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Gorgeous Greek billionaire Leandro plucked plump Millie from her farm and swept her into his glamorous world! Wrapped in his arms, draped in diamonds, she thought nothing could touch them. But the deepest, darkest betrayal did. Her sister claimed she was expecting Leandro&#39;s baby. So Millie ran away, distraught.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The designer dresses had clearly never hidden how unsuitable and unglamorous she truly was. Now, though, Leandro&#39;s powerful voice is demanding his wife come home. . . And, to her shame, she&#39;s willing. . .&lt;/p&gt;
