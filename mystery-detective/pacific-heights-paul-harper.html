  <title>Pacific Heights - Paul Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A San Francisco detective becomes entangled with a private intelligence agency as he investigates what appears to be a traceless form of murder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple meets in a seedy hotel room for an illicit affair, the rules of which are simple: no names, no personal details, the specifics of their lives off-limits. It&#39;s all very exciting to Lore Cha--the wife of a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur--who thinks their forbidden meetings and taboo sexual encounters are exactly the escape she&#39;s been looking for: every single detail is as she imagined. But that&#39;s the problem. Phillip Krey anticipates every thought before she has it. He plays out her untold fantasies down to the last detail. His insights are beyond intuitive; they&#39;re invasive, even frightening. It&#39;s as if he has access into her mind. Across town, Elise Currin, wife to one of San Francisco&#39;s most powerful businessmen, is also seeing Krey, and is slowly being driven insane by his ability to tap in to her most private desires. When it&#39;s revealed that these women are also seeing the same therapist, a chilling scenario unfolds, and the quiet, plotting detective Marten Fane is called in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly Fane uncovers a plot that goes beyond Krey to reveal a powerful private sector, secret government involvement, and one of the most elaborate and monstrous psychological experiments imaginable: a traceless form of murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot; ... Harper succeeds in sympathetically portraying Elise and Lore as they face genuine danger. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
