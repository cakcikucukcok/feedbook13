  <title>The Wind from Heaven&#39;s Window - Pat Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection is a combination of romantic, philosophic, mystical, and spiritual poetry written to warm even the coldest of hearts. They come from a very inspired place that speaks of a great desire to understand ourselves. The elusive butterfly in all of us, that out of its innate curiosity to learn and experience things by necessity, transforms itself. They also speak of the unique place that we all share in the divine tapestry we call life and how we are all intimately connected. The poems reflect on the betrayal and hypocrisy that we all inevitably encounter on our journey through life. 
Most importantly, a message of hope and joy runs through them, so that we are always reminded that even in our darkest moments, the light of truth and love has never abandoned us.
The book also shares some of the stories that inspired and motivated some of the poems. They run the gamut, from gut-wrenching tearjerkers to deeply impassioned pleas for universal kindness to the whimsical frolic of a playful little child.
Included is a section titled Musings on Life. These are philosophic perspectives intended to be life lessons for the reader. Its been said that not all men are masters, but all masters have been men. Along that same line of thinking, the author feels that although not all philosophers are poets, all poets are philosophers." />
