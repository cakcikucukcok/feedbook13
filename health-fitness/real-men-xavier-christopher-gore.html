  <title>Real Men - Xavier Christopher Gore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My main goal for writing Real Men was to give my own opinion on the deceptive images of men in society. Men in the media and entertainment are portray as robots with no emotions. Insensitive to the feelings of others. We are given negative images as far as our activity and contributions to families. The Mommas Baby, Poppas Maybe syndrome is alive and well. I personally know many single parent men.  Men (such as myself) who cook better than women. Men who maintain their house holds by themselves. Men who have put their sons and daughters through college and have worked multiple jobs to accomplish these goals. 
     There is evidently a problem with crime in my community and all communities now. There is an excessive amount of men (especially Black Men) in the justice system that are there simply due to color and lack of equal representation and money for adequate lawyers to fight their cases. I feel like through my writing I can approach problems head on and direct. I want to do this in a no holds manner. This is just my own personal view point and opinion. Drugs, immorality, deviant sexual practices, lack of self worth, low self image and the basic lack of historical worth has led to many individuals losing respect for themselves and others. I feel we are all role models and have a duty to the youth and others to step up and lead where others wont. Real Men and its upcoming volumes is my personal contribution to Men, Women and ethnicities who have not had a voice for so long. I feel like this could also give others insight on what I go through and possibly educate those who let ignorance be their guide. Music, sports, and acting have been said to be our only ways out of poverty and prison. I feel like education and discipline are the keys. Knowledge of God and Self are essential now more than ever...
