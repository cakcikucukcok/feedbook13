  <title>A Parent’S Guide to a Peaceful Home - Patricia Braxton, Paris Simone Brower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parents serve as their childrens first teachers. What they learn at home helps them build on their learning and education at school. In A Parents Guide to a Peaceful Home, author Patricia Braxton provides a guide to helping parents manage their home in a peaceful, loving way in order to ensure success for their children at home and at school.
This handbook presents Braxtons TAD (Toward Affective Development) model, which gives practical advice to help parents teach their children responsibility, respect, discipline, and other positive character traits. It also teaches parents how to relate to each other properly and how to affect change from within.
