  <title>50 Things Every Young Gentleman Should Know Revised and   Upated - John Bridges, Bryan Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;50 Things Every Young Gentleman Should Know&lt;/em&gt; is a young man&amp;rsquo;s guide to becoming the type of guy that people respect and enjoy. He knows how to shake hands. He knows how to be a good sport. He knows how to give a genuine compliment and how to speak his mind without being offensive. His friends listen to what he has to say, and he returns the favor. He knows how to achieve the perfect knot in a necktie, and more important, he knows when he should be wearing a tie in the first place. Oh, and his favorite ball cap? He knows when to wear it and when to leave it at home on his dresser. Becoming a gentleman doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in an instant; it&amp;rsquo;s a lifelong exercise in refining etiquette, social interaction, and personal discipline. It all begins here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
