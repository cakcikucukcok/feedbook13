  <title>The Perfect Liar - Thomas Christopher Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A taut, well-written thriller...The pace is crisp, the surprises keep coming, and there are two big ones that readers are unlikely to see coming.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A seemingly perfect marriage is threatened by the deadly secrets husband and wife keep from each other.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Susannah, a young widow and single mother, has remarried well: to Max, a charismatic artist and popular speaker whose career took her and her fifteen-year-old son out of New York City and to a quiet Vermont university town. Strong-willed and attractive, Susannah expects that her life is perfectly in place again. Then one quiet morning she finds a note on her door: I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max dismisses the note as a prank. But days after a neighborhood couple comes to dinner, the husband mysteriously dies in a tragic accident while on a run with Max. Soon thereafter, a second note appears on their door: DID YOU GET AWAY WITH IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Susannah and Max are keeping secrets from the world and from each other--secrets that could destroy their family and everything they have built. Thomas Christopher Greene&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Liar&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling novel told through the alternating perspectives of Susannah and Max with a shocking climax that no one will expect, from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Headmaster&#39;s Wife.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
