  <title>Experiencing Chick Corea - Monika Herzig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;With twenty-three Grammy wins, Chick Corea is a legendary jazz figure and one of the most prolific and influential contemporary pianists of our time. He has produced hundreds of releases in multiple genres over five decades, and he is one of the hardest-working musicians in the industry, with a yearly tour schedule of over 250 international concerts. He has authored multiple books and instructional works, and many regard him today as easily one of the most influential musicians of his generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Experiencing Chick Corea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; looks at the full span of Corea&amp;rsquo;s career, decade by decade, touching on the vast array of musical styles he engaged, from his initial work with Herbie Mann to his free explorations with Circle. It touches on his arguably most influential album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Now He Sings, Now He Sobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, his involvement with Miles Davis&amp;rsquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Bitches Brew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and subsequent efforts as pioneer in the fusion scene with Return to Forever, his duo collaborations, classical outings, and his acoustic and trio work in the 1990s and beyond. Learning how to listen to Corea is itself a bit of a magic carpet ride, given the range of material he has created and the breadth and depth of that work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Experiencing Chick Corea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; introduces this American Icon to audiences beyond the domain of jazz fans already familiar with this work. Monika Herzig places Corea&amp;rsquo;s creations in their historical and social contexts so any music lover can gain a fuller understanding of the incredible range of his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
