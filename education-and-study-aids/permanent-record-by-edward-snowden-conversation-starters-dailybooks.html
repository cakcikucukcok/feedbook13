      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Permanent Record by Edward Snowden: Conversation Starters&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Permanent Record is an autobiography by Edward Snowden. It is about power, corruption, courage, and heroism that explains the reality behind the government&amp;rsquo;s ability to control everything using technology. The book was intentionally published and released on Constitution Day, September 17, 2019, by Metropolitan Books because of the event being mentioned in the book. Snowden revealed to the world how the government of the United States was invading the private lives of every person by collecting every single phone call, message, and email and how he used to work for them. His revelations sparked a controversy about the questionable security of each person&amp;rsquo;s privacy and surveillance. When the book was released, the United States filed a lawsuit for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and the NSA against Snowden.&lt;br /&gt;
On October 6, 2019, the book ranked number two on the New York Times Hard Cover Nonfiction best-sellers and on the Combined Print &amp;amp; E-Book Nonfiction best-sellers&amp;rsquo; list.&lt;br /&gt;
