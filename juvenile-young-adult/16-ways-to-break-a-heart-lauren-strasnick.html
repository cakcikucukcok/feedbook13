  <title>16 Ways to Break a Heart - Lauren Strasnick</title>

Witty banter and sizzling chemistry made falling in love easy&amp;#8212;even inevitable. He was in awe of her subversive art and contagious zest for life; she was drawn to his good-guy charm and drive to succeed as a documentary filmmaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was before. Before hot tempers turned to blowout fights. Before a few little lies turned to broken trust. Before a hundred tiny slights broke them open and exposed the ugly truth of their relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now Natalie wants Dan to know just how much he broke her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of one fateful day, Dan reads sixteen letters that Natalie has secretly, brilliantly hidden in places only he will find. And as he pieces together her version of their love story, he realizes that she has one final message for him. One that might just send his carefully constructed life tumbling down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
