Suddenly, as if a switch had been flipped, Josiah&#39;s nerves shake away and his words come rushing out, his whole body fills to the brim with the certainty of a strange apocalyptic vision. But is it true prophecy or just a young believer&#39;s imagination running wild? Decades later when Josiah (now Josie) is grown and has long since left the church, he returns to Queens to care for his father who, day by day, is losing his grip on reality. Barreling through the old neighborhood, memories of the past--of his childhood friend Issy, of his first love, of the mother he has yet to properly mourn--overwhelm him at every turn. When he arrives at his family&#39;s old house, he&#39;s completely unprepared for what he finds. How far back must one man journey to heal a broken bond between father and son?&lt;br&gt;In rhapsodic language steeped in the oral tradition of American evangelism, Scott Cheshire brings us under his spell. Remarkable in scale--moving from 1980 Queens, to sunny present-day California, to a tent revival in nineteenth century rural Kentucky--and shot-through with the power and danger of belief and the love that binds generations, &lt;i&gt;High as the Horses&#39; Bridles&lt;/i&gt; is a bold, heartbreaking debut from a big new American voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
