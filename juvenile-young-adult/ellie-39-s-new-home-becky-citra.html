  <title>Ellie&#39;s New Home - Becky Citra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ellie and her little brother Max find themselves moving from their grandmother&#39;s comfortable home in England to Upper Canada. Their mother is dead, Father wants to start over again, and in 1835 there are many opportunities for settlers in British North America. Despite the strangeness of this vast new world, Ellie is sure things will turn out all right, as long as the family stays together. But once they are in Upper Canada, Father leaves Ellie and Max with strangers on an isolated homestead, while he goes on ahead to find land and build a cabin. Although the mother and father are kind to her, Ellie makes an enemy of their daughter Mary, who is insulted by the newcomer&#39;s distant manners, fine clothes and talk of her London home. Ellie&#39;s loneliness and discomfort, however, gradually turns into a growing fear. Where is Father? Why hasn&#39;t he come back to them? A gripping story for young readers that explored the world of early settlers." />
