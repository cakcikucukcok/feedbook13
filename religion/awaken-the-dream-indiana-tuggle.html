  <title>Awaken The Dream - Indiana Tuggle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s holding you back from making your dreams a reality? Is it your past, limited education, family obligations, lack of confidence, low self-esteem, fear, time, money, or lack of support from others? Or perhaps you started but then the storm came, accusation aroused, friends and loved ones turned their backs and your life slowly spiraled out of control! Regardless of your current state, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to remember that you were created for greatness, that there is a miraculous calling on your life, that all things will work together for your good or that the storm won&amp;rsquo;t last always. Indiana knows what you are going through, and has provided just the dose of inspiration to get you moving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awaken the Dream, filled with 90-days of encouragement, serves as a reminder of God&amp;rsquo;s everlasting love for you and His plan for greatness for your life. With daily prayers and &amp;lsquo;Reflections and Reaction&amp;rsquo; exercises, each devotional is intended to motivate you to continue to stand on the promises of God while helping you to examine yourself and live a life holy and presentable unto Him representing Christ in all your endeavors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Awaken the Dream is that it is numbered rather than dated, therefore you can mark your favorite devotional and pick it up whenever you need a dose of encouragement or kick in the butt to stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. - Habakkuk 2:3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
