  <title>&#39;Til Death Do Us Part - Winifred Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Winifred felt defeated. After numerous hours researching the disease and its symptoms, she began to understand the progression of multiple sclerosis. If she hoped to live a full life with this disease, Winifreds attitude toward the condition would need to change. Keeping that in mind, she adapted pieces of her life to enhance her mobility and make her daily life less difficult to navigate.
She approaches the subject in a way that makes the reader feel engaged as she is frank about her feelings, the disease that she calls the monster, treatments currently available, and the gaps in the medical care she received. Her research sent her approach to fighting this disease into an entirely different direction.
Winifred offers her readers a platform to discuss their own journey with multiple sclerosis by giving them an e-mail address and her contact information for them to be able to reach out to her on Twitter.
Knowing that there is currently no cure, Winifred refers to multiple sclerosis as her life partner. Her new outlook in life is inspiring. This is the biggest battle of her life, and Winifred intends to win!" />
