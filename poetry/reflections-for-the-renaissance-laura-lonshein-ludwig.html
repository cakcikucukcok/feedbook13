  <title>Reflections for the Renaissance - Laura Lonshein Ludwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Laura Lonshein Ludwig: poet, recipient of four New York State Council for the Arts Grants, listed in Whos Who in the World in 2004 for her work as a screenwriter, satirist, poet, actress, and director.  Laura has performed on stages across the nation, on radio, TV, and in poetry venues.  Regional editor for upstate New York for Medicinal Purposes Literary Review, previously the staff assistant for the New Press Literary Quarterly, and a producer with the Museum of Sound Recording, Lauras plays and poetry can be heard on shows created by Teachers and Writers Collaborative, WNYE, The Light Show (WBAI 99.5 FM), Earth Bird, Channel 57, MNN.  Lauras poetry can be heard on the Joe Franklins Memory Lane radio program at WOR AM, hosted by Joe Franklin and cohosted by Richard Ornstein, who is the cowriter of the newest screenplay Laura wrote, The Desk.  Sounds like a Plot, Ms. Ludwigs last book, was reviewed by the comic Professor Irwin Corey.  In these masters of the art, one finds the writer.  Laura received outstanding reviews from Al Lewis (radio actor on WBAIs The Al Lewis program with Karen Lewis; Frederick Geo Bold, The Light Show producer and host; Dr. Joseph S. Salemi, New York University professor, poet, translator, scholar, Department of Classics, Brooklyn College) for the first book Robo Sapiens. The reviews and other reviews are to be found in this book, Reflections for the Renaissance.  Ms. Ludwigs work can be found in the Mid-Manhattan Library, NYU Bobst Library, the Brooklyn Library, and published in over sixty literary publications.  The Xlibris website and all major websites, such as the Barnes and Noble (through Xlibris by e-mail and phone), the St. Marks Bookshop, and City Lights Booksellers in San Francisco, California.  Available worldwide; Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble bookstores can order it for you with other books and chapbooks by Laura Lonshein Ludwig.  Reflections for the Renaissance is a book of poetry on the masters in literature, theatre, and the screen, for art is life, and life can only be art by loving art itself.  The delight and experience in reading the masters in literature and studying the great writers, comics, producers, and artists throughout the ages that have moved Ms. Ludwig to the pen and to the screen.  Also included in this collection is The Man on the Street Is without a Prayer, the screenplay that Richard Ornstein compared to Duck Soup, the genius of the Marx Brothers, and Ms. Ludwigs work to Mel Brooks.  Short comic plays are included as well.  Ms. Ludwig studied acting at the Gene Frankel Theatre, attended Franconia College, and worked in sales and customer relations for twenty years.  In a desire to produce television that educates and provides the community with the arts, Ms. Ludwig offered ballet, opera, theatre, poetry, plays, and films to present her screenplays and the work of other artists and activists for ten years in pursuit of program time offering a budget.  Brooklyn cable-access TV
offered the public and Ms. Ludwig an opportunity to enjoy television made through concern and a love of art.  Creating the show with attention to the value of language and art, it was a top-rated program combining the rising artists of New Yorkthe new artists that have studied their craft with the stars.  Ms. Ludwig presented some of the great stars in film, radio, and TV.  The American dream is to enjoy good literature, and film, to reach for the fruits of your labor in the quest to be part of the renaissance in art.  In that quest is the art of today and those that influence and encourage the creation of art.  Reflections for the Renaissance honors the artists that I have worked with and who inspired many other artists in the New York poetry circuit, while creating a new body of art to be treasured and to help shape the new renaissance in art for the twenty-first century." />
