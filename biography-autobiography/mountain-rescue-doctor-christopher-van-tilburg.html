  <title>Mountain Rescue Doctor - Christopher Van Tilburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A fast-paced account of Mt. Hood. For readers who are unfamiliar with the rugged and beautiful Hood River area, [Van Tilburg] balances its undeniable perils with the joys of its scenic wonders . . .&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publisher&#39;s Weekly&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Van Tilburg&#39;s dogged spadework in translating to the page the intricate essentials of his unique trade makes each breathtaking rescue literally come to life. Exhilarating take on the daily life of a unique brand of doctor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a medical doctor, a previously published author (Backcountry Snowboarding; Introducing Your Kids to the Outdoors), and an adventure-sports devotee himself, Van Tilburg is uniquely qualified to describe the fears, excitement, frustration, and rewards of these searches. He examines the high costs of search-and-rescue operations and provides an interesting overview of the debate on whether victims should be held responsible for some of these costs. Young adults will likely enjoy this introduction to the field of wilderness medicine. Filled with adventure and good advice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Outdoors folk in Oregon have long benefited from Dr. Chris Van Tilburg&#39;s skills as an emergency doctor and his selfless devotion to rescuing injured hikers and climbers as a volunteer for his local mountain rescue service. Now his other great skill--as a writer--has brought these exciting tales to the country at large. Chris captures the excitement of a rescue with the passion of a true mountaineer, and does so in highly readable prose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--John Harlin III, Editor of &lt;i&gt;The American Alpine Journal&lt;/i&gt; and author of &lt;i&gt;The Eiger Obsession, Mount Rainier &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt;  The Climber&#39;s Guide to North America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Van Tilburg, MD is an emergency room physician, a ski patrol doctor, an emergency wilderness physician, and a member of the Hood River Crag Rats, the oldest mountain rescue team in the country. When Dr. Van Tilburg&#39;s beeper goes off, the call may take him racing up a mountain peak to rescue an injured hiker, scaling a rocky ledge to intubate a hiker who has fallen over a cliff, into a blizzard to search for missing skiers, or to a mountain airplane crash scene for body recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Van Tilburg&#39;s work requires a unique combination of emergency medicine, survival skills, agility, and extreme sports. In &lt;i&gt;Mountain Rescue Doctor&lt;/i&gt;, Van Tilburg shares personal stories of harrowing and suspenseful rescues and recoveries, including the recent Mount Hood disaster, which claimed the lives of three climbers.  We learn about the tools and techniques of emergency wilderness medicine, as well as the feats of human strength and delicacy required to treat patients under extreme conditions. And finally, we confront some of the ethical challenges a wilderness physician faces in making tough choices about who can be saved and at what cost. &lt;i&gt;Mountain Rescue Doctor&lt;/i&gt; is an exhilarating tour through the perils of nature and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
