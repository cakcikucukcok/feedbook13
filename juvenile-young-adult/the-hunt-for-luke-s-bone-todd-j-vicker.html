  <title>The Hunt for Luke’S Bone - Todd J. Vicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Book evolved from my dog Luke.  He is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  I always wanted to do a 
childrens book since going to college at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, but I never could come up with a character until I got Luke!  And what a character he is!  I believe everyone at some point in their life should own a dog.  They are such great companions.  You could have the worst day ever, and a dog will always be by your side to help you feel better.
   I want to thank my two daughters, my wife, my mom and dad, along with my family and friends that helped me and supported me in creating this book.
   Just for fun... See if you can find Lukes Bone on each page!  Also, try to find two faces smiling from above!  Sometimes we can find what we are looking for, and sometimes we cant." />
