  <title>The Whole Way Home - Sarah Creech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A radiant talent on the brink of making it big in Nashville must confront her small-town past and an old love she&amp;#8217;s never forgotten in this engaging novel&amp;#8212;a soulful ballad filled with romance, heartbreak, secrets, and scandal from the author of &lt;em&gt;Season of the Dragonflies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing to packed houses while her hit song rushes up the charts, country singer and fiddler Jo Lover is poised to become a one-name Nashville star like her idols, Loretta, Reba, and Dolly. To ensure her success, Jo has carefully crafted her image: a pretty, sassy, down-to-earth girl from small-town Virginia who pours her heart into her songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the stage persona she&amp;#8217;s built is threatened when her independent label merges with big-time Capitol Records, bringing Nashville heartthrob JD Gunn&amp;#8212;her first love&amp;#8212;back into her life. Long ago Jo played with JD&amp;#8217;s band. But they parted ways, and took their own crooked roads to stardom. Now Jo&amp;#8217;s excited&amp;#8212;and terrified&amp;#8212;to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the label reunites them for a show, the old sparks fly, the duet they sing goes viral, and fans begin clamoring for more&amp;#8212;igniting the media&amp;#8217;s interest in the compelling singer. Why is a small-town girl like Jo so quiet about her past? When did she and JD first meet? What split them apart? All too soon, the painful secret she&amp;#8217;s been hiding is uncovered, a shocking revelation that threatens to destroy her reputation and her dreams. To salvage her life and her career, Jo must finally face the past&amp;#8212;and her feelings for JD&amp;#8212;to become the true Nashville diva she was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
