  <title>Miss Understanding - Stephanie Lessing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zoe Rose never quite fit in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the only kid in kindergarten with an enormous red afro, Zoe was taunted by the other little girls for refusing to share her &quot;Annie&quot; wig, even when she swore it was her own hair (it was).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In second grade, after seeing her best friend ridiculed for wearing a dirty, pink, polka-dot party dress to school every day, she became obsessed with understanding what makes &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; girls tick and why they&#39;re so cruel to the girls who never seem to &quot;get it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Zoe begins a lifelong study of girl behavior, and by thirty, finds herself editor of &lt;em&gt;Issues&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Determined to raid the locker room of the female psyche and rip open the frilly fa&amp;#231;ade of femininity once and for all, she sets out to reform an entire nation of women, beginning with the readers of the most notorious magazine on Madison Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the feminist vs. the fashionistas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Zoe stop girls from behaving badly toward other girls, and turn them into a strong, united force that can succeed in our male-dominated world?  Or will her spectacularly warped sense of humor, pathetic wardrobe, and plethora of psychosomatic illnesses get her eaten alive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe&#39;s willing to risk losing it all, including her mind, but she&#39;ll walk away with something she never dreamed she wanted: the little girl hiding inside of her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
