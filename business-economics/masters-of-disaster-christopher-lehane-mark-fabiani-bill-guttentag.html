  <title>Masters of Disaster - Christopher Lehane, Mark Fabiani, Bill Guttentag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The foolproof guide to damage control from the &quot;masters of disaster&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re a politician caught with his pants down, a publicly traded company accused of accounting improprieties, a family-owned restaurant with a lousy Yelp review or just the guy in the corner cubicle who inadvertently pushed &quot;reply all,&quot; a crisis doesn&#39;t have to be the make-or-break moment of your career. For those of us that aren&#39;t natural spin doctors, it&#39;s hard to resist the impulse to cover your tracks, lie, or act like nothing happened. But resist you must!&lt;br&gt;In Masters of Disaster, Christopher Lehane and Mark Fabiani, reveal the magic formula you need to take control when it&#39;s your turn to be sucked into the vortex of the modern spin cycle. Covering the ten commandments of damage control, and based on their work for clients like Bill Clinton, Goldman Sachs and Hollywood studios, the authors outline the strategies that can make real time news alerts, Twitter trend lines and viral videos work for you rather against you. Full of both lively personal anecdotes and hard-knuckled straight talk, this is a must-read for anyone who wants to emerge with their reputation intact.&lt;/p&gt;" />
