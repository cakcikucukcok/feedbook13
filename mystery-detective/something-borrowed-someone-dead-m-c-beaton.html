  <title>Something Borrowed, Someone Dead - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed, Someone Dead &lt;/i&gt;continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gloria French was a jolly widow with dyed blonde hair, a raucous laugh and rosy cheeks. When she first moved from London to the charming Cotswolds hills, she was heartily welcomed.  She seemed a do-gooder par excellence, raising funds for the church and caring for the elderly.  But she had a nasty habit of borrowing things and not giving them back, just small things, a teapot here, a set of silverware there.  So it&#39;s quite the shock when she is found dead, murdered by a poisoned bottle of elderberry wine.  Afraid the murder will be a blight on the small town, Parish councillor, Jerry Tarrant, hires private detective Agatha Raisin to track down the murderer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the village is secretive and the residents resent Agatha&#39;s investigation. Of course that doesn&#39;t stop the ever-persistent Agatha from investigating and sticking her nose where no one wants it--especially as the suspect list grows. And, as if it isn&#39;t enough that Agatha&#39;s ex has reentered the picture, the murderer is now targeting Agatha!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With M.C. Beaton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed, Someone Dead  &lt;/i&gt;the bossy, vain, and absolutely irresistible, Agatha Raisin continues to be a fan favorite.&lt;/p&gt;" />
