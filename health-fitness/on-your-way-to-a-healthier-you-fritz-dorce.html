  <title>On Your Way to a Healthier You - Fritz Dorce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me (Philippians 4:13).
I decided to write this book because I have encountered so many people who are misinformed about their health and, because of that, they make poor choices on a daily basis. I want to thank God for giving me the knowledge and understanding of this subject in order to share it with others. Most of the wisdom cited in this book comes from the greatest book ever written, the Bible. Thanks be to God. 
I want to give special thanks to my friends Ketia and Daniel Jacques for their constant support, to my sister in Christ, Samantha Miller for her help, and my beautiful mom, Alcine Dorce, for giving me life. I want to thank The Ministry of Healing and all the books, articles, and resources that contributed to the completion of this book. 
This book does not replace your doctor or any treatment your doctor has prescribed for you. This book is intended to educate and make you aware of options available which can help you to make wiser choices concerning your health. In everything that you do, call on the name of God Almighty to give you direction. Prepare yourself to make sacrifices and give your best effort, and let God handle the rest. 
Winston Churchill and others have said that failing to plan is planning to fail. I wish that you plan to succeed by Gods grace." />
