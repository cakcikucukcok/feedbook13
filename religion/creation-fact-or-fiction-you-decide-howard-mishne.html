  <title>Creation: Fact or Fiction - You Decide - Howard Mishne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally! Heres a book about Creation that you dont have to be a rocket scientist or Bible scholar to understand. For most people, complex biblical and scientific studies of our origin are boring. They make your head spin by the end of the first few pages. Thats not what this book is going to be like for you. This book is for us typical people.
When you talk with believers of Creation, some will tell you to just read the Bible. Others say This can only be Gods work or What else could it be? Or they try to poke holes in the well-known theories. Creation is not a theory; its a belief. You either believe it or you dont. So how do you believe in something that nobody can prove?
In his first book, Howard Mishne combines interesting and cool facts with basic science to methodically tie it all together. From the universe down to the very unique aspects of our life on earth, he lays out an easy-to-understand perspective in ways you havent thought about before. Instead of trying to answer the questions, Howard lets you decide by looking at our existence in a different way." />
