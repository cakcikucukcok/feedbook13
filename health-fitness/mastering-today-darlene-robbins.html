  <title>Mastering Today - Darlene Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Journey to Freedom is my path of self-discovery by peeling away false beliefs imposed upon by family and society. Once you make the conscious decision to discover who you are and what you really believe and think, you can look at the world from a different perspective and approach it with willful excitement and joy. My story is how I moved through discovering myself to how I choose to perceive and live in the world. We all have that right, to perceive and live in the world on our own terms. Once you realize that seeking approval from others and trying to fit in will only bring you misery, is when the butterfly within you will emerge. Our mind/body connection is the beginning of the journey. This journey has given me the ability to discover who I truly am and what I truly believe and think. Through awareness, consciousness and honesty with myself, I have emerged with a profound understanding of life. If you are struggling and not completely happy with your life, join me on My Journey and allow me to show you how to free yourself of unwanted and unnecessary thoughts to evolve with a greater understanding of who you are and what you truly desire." />
