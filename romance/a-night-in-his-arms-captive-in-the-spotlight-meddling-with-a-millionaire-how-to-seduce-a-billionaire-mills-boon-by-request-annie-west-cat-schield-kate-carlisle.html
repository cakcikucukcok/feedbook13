          &lt;strong&gt;There are many consequences to just one night of passion…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captive in the Spotlight &lt;/em&gt;by Annie West &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Irresistibly handsome Domenico Volpe is in the spotlight after a recent family tragedy. And now the woman at the centre of it, Lucy Knight, has been released from prison and Domenico is demanding answers! But he doesn’t expect the shy, innocent, woman behind the tough façade…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meddling with a Millionaire&lt;/em&gt; by Cat Shield&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emma Montgomery wouldn’t be manipulated into marriage as part of a business deal – not even if Daddy cut off access to her trust fund. Too bad her intended groom – ruthless businessman and former crush Nathan Case – had her nearly betraying herself at every turn!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Seduce a Billionaire&lt;/em&gt; by Kate Carlisle&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kelly Meredith has returned from holiday as a completely new woman! She says this makeover is part of a plan…a very seductive plan. And boss Brandon Duke is just the man to give her a few lessons in love, savour every moment and then say goodbye – as long as he remembers who is seducing who!&lt;/p&gt;
