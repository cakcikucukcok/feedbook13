  <title>Kimberly’S Hmmmings - Kimberly McGary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Join Kimberly as she journeys through the difficulties of breast cancer. Be strengthened as she shares the encouragement God gives each day. Kimberly graduated from the University of Missouri, St. Louis with a B.A. degree in Communications and holds a Certificate in Writing. She finds joy in sharing Gods faithfulness in the counseling ministry of her church. She and Ellie May, her beloved, rescued Rottweiler became a certified touch therapy team and made visits to nursing homes and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The most unique individual Christian woman I have ever met is Kimberly McGary. Despite adversity which would destroy the average person, she thrives on difficulties, disappointments and illness as a manifestation that her Heavenly Father is preparing her to serve Him. After giving an update of her physical and mental condition, Kimberly shares with a joyful, positive spirit the Scripture promises that encouraged and sustained her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Curtis T. Porter, Transitional Pastor and  Marriage and Family Counselor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly McGary has beautifully and honestly recorded her thoughts as she has experienced the pain, suffering, and questions that come from battling cancer. Her deep faith in God is an inspiration and encouragement to all who know her, and it will inspire all who read her story of trusting God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Charles McLain, Senior Pastor,  First Baptist Church of Festus-Crystal City&lt;/p&gt;" />
