  <title>The Stranger’S Touch - Donald E. Mackay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been called short story, fiction, literature. The stories cover a wide range of genres. It contains a bit of soft, science fiction, easy philosophy, and several intense love stories. If the question should come up in conversation as to why one should not tempt the Creator this story, &quot;The Stranger&#39;s Touch&quot;, will offer a very good reason why you should avoid that action like the black plague. This love story, &quot;A Desert Blooms&quot;, proves love can bloom anywhere, even in the middle of a war zone. This next story is about an engagement ring, found on a country road, and it opens a story about one man who died in war and one man who lived and the woman who lost the ring. The two men were on the same bomber that was shot down over France. Another story offers the horror for a man who was convicted of murder, and sent to prison for life; he&#39;s innocent, but he cannot prove it, and he decides to escape. A reporter tells this story, with a good deal of empathy. It was a heart rending tale of sorrow and frustration. The Creator moves in all these stories." />
