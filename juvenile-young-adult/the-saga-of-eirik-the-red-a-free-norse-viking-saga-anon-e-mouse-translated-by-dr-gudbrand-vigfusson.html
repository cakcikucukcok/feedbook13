  <title>THE SAGA OF EIRIK THE RED - A Free Norse/Viking Saga - Anon E. Mouse, Translated by Dr. Gudbrand Vigfusson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Saga of Erik the Red is thought to have been composed before 1265AD on the Norse exploration of North-America. The saga also details the events that led to Erik the Red&amp;#39;s banishment to Greenland and Leif Ericson&amp;#39;s preaching of Christianity as well as his discovery of Vinland (America) after his longship was blown off course. By geographical details, this place is thought to be present-day Newfoundland, and was probably the first European discovery of the American mainland, some five centuries before Christopher Columbus&amp;#39;s arrival in the Antilles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The saga also chronicles the life and expedition of Thorfinn Karlsefni and his wife Gudrid, characters also seen in the Greenland saga.&lt;br /&gt;
This translation is made from the version of the Saga printed in Dr. Gudbrand Vigfusson&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Icelandic Prose Reader&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: It may be mentioned here that Carl Christian Rafn and the other Danish scholars who edited this elaborate work have concluded that Kjalarnes is the modern Cape Cod, Straumsfjordr is Buzzard&amp;#39;s Bay, Straumsey is Martha&amp;#39;s Vineyard, and Hop is on the shores of Mount Haup Bay, into which the river Taunton flows.&lt;br /&gt;
