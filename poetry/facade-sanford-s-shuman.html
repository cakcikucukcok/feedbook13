  <title>Facade - Sanford S. Shuman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his second poetry collection, &lt;i&gt;Facade...In Every Mortal Lies a 
Dormant god!,&lt;/i&gt; Sanford Shuman continues his serious exploration 
of life. This poetry should elevate your consciousness and inspire you 
to live the extraordinary existence that GOD ordained for you in the 
very beginning of your life. 
&lt;p&gt;Shuman remembers that there was an era when it was against the law for 
some ethnic groups to read or even show the slightest interest in 
knowledge or becoming educated. But he reminds us that the old saying, 
Knowledge is Power, is so very true. This collection is divided into 
four chapters: Passion and Emotions; Notions and Motivations; Divine and 
Frame of Mind; and Rebellion and Unrest! &lt;i&gt;Facade&lt;/i&gt; 
offers poems for any occasion for those seeking insight and knowledge. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobility&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Two wrongs dont make a right, 
&lt;p&gt;Thats like confusing day for night. 
&lt;p&gt;The good will always get ahead, 
&lt;p&gt;To promote iniquity is something one should dread. 
&lt;p&gt;Victory has a great cost, 
&lt;p&gt;But, if one gives up all hope is lost. 
&lt;p&gt;In this life, some things, one is sure to lose, 
&lt;p&gt;But, you can gain much more if you choose. 
&lt;p&gt;Troubles are suppose to only make, 
&lt;p&gt;To think youll have enduring success without a battle is a 
mistake.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faade
&lt;p&gt;by Sanford Shuman
&lt;p&gt;If you like, roses are red; violets are blue, this book is not for you.
&lt;p&gt;The index is set for one to find a verse to fit the mood of the moment.
&lt;p&gt;Loves Bliss could be a modern wedding vow to the bride.
&lt;p&gt;Single men take note, buy this book and learn some new lines.
&lt;p&gt;Helen of Troy may have caused ships to sink.  In this body of work ladies are treated as delicate flowers the bees pay homage and drunken sailors choose to leave on the high tide than to sully them.
&lt;p&gt;Humor in Practically Bewitching will make the women holla!
&lt;p&gt;As you read you will dog ear the pages or use mini-tabs to mark your favorite sections.
&lt;p&gt;Sanford has reached back to the old souls to elicit every emotion we can feel today.
&lt;p&gt;Reading Faade  I caught myself crying and being happy at the same time.
For me Faade is irony.
