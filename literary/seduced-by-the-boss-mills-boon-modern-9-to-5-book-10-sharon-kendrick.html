            &lt;em&gt;Mills &amp; Boon are proud to present a thrilling digital collection of all Sharon Kendrick’s novels and novellas for us to celebrate the publication of her amazing 100th book! Many of these books are available as e books for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Putting the personal in P.A! From Secretary…to his mistress&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Dan McKnight asked his down to earth secretary Megan Phillips to be his plus one at his brother’s engagement party, she said yes without a thought, convinced it would be nothing more than business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly Megan is transformed into a sexy siren, but Dan is still determined to keep his hands off his secretary…until they are forced – for appearances sake – to share the same bed!&lt;br /&gt;As their attraction sizzles, Megan and Dan quickly go from faking it to making it. The only problem was that the pretence was supposed to end when they were back at work…&lt;/p&gt;
