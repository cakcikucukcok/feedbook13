  <title>An Insider&#39;s Guide to Smart Investing - Sun-Jung Choi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While most people know that investing for the future is something they should do, you&amp;rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find people chatting about the types of mutual funds, comparing their advisers, or discussing the cost structure of various investment products. Learning how to make money through investing sounds appealing, but the process itself often seems boring or complicated. However, having the basic knowledge about how investing works is a must-have skill, not an option, in order to succeed in investing in the long run. It takes time and effort to be a smart investor, but the journey doesn&amp;#39;t have to be too academic or filled with jargon. Don&amp;#39;t get intimidated by all the terminology. An Insider&amp;#39;s Guide to Smart Investing uses everyday analogies and speaks your language. Over time, the analogies will live with you as essential stepping stones to smart investing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
