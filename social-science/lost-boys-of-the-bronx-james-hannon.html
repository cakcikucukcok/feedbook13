  <title>Lost Boys of the Bronx - James Hannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Richard Price&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Academy Award nominated screenwriter and mainstream author of &lt;STRONG&gt;The Wanderers&lt;/STRONG&gt; says, &lt;BR&gt;&quot;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I read through [Lost Boys of the Bronx] in one sitting - It was GREAT!&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Straight from the streets of the mid-1960s Bronx comes a book about one of the borough&#39;s most feared gangs - The Ducky Boys. While their unusual name alone might contradict their reputation, in the Norwood/Bainbridge section of the Bronx their appearances provoked an ominous dread. So much so, that when Richard Price needed inspiration for a terrifying gang in his novel (and later movie) &lt;I&gt;The Wanderers&lt;/I&gt;, he knew exactly which gang to choose. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lost Boys of the Bronx&lt;/B&gt; tells the story of the Ducky Boys in their own words. It is a story of how a few pre-teen kids in the Botanical Gardens turned into a gang of hundreds - and a gang so alarming that rumors of their arrival would shut down local schools. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is also a study of the mostly Irish Bronx neighborhood in which the Ducky Boys were born, and where so many of the Ducky kids got caught up in the tumultuous times of the &#39;60s where their fierce loyalty was the only thing that got them through.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is not your typical gang book. It neither praises nor demonizes the gang for the things they did, but rather simply reports what happened - warts and all. You&#39;ll see the truth behind the Ducky Boys&#39; gang - their lives, their loves, their pranks and crimes, and so much more. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To borrow from a particular product&#39;s slogan - with a name like the Ducky Boys, you knew they HAD to be tough.&lt;/P&gt;
