  <title>Cameron&#39;s Law - Harry Sholk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Matt Cameron likes being a federal lawman, and he&#39;s good at it. But an unexpected transfer from Wyoming to Oklahoma Territory was the last thing he needed.&lt;p&gt;
On arriving in his hometown to investigate an Army payroll robbery in which three soldiers had been murdered, he runs into the same attitudes that had driven him away sixteen years earlier. His father, Pete Cameron, a well-respected cattle rancher, has never forgiven him for leaving without a word. Under orders to conduct his investigation in secret, Matt has no choice but to endure Pete&#39;s constant badgering. But where is his breaking point? It had been a long time since any man had gotten away with humiliating him.&lt;p&gt;
To add to his difficulties, the town ne&#39;er-do-well, Billy Butler, also has some unfinished business with him. This state of affairs only strengthens his resolve. Never again will he pay, with feelings of shame and guilt, for the mistakes of his youth. The long overdue showdown with his father and Butler will be the first order of business following the investigation&#39;s conclusion ...&lt;p&gt;" />
