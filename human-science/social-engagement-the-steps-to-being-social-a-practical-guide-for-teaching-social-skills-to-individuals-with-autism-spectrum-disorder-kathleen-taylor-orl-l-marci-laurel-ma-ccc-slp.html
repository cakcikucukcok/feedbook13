  <title>Social Engagement &amp; the Steps to Being Social: A Practical Guide for Teaching Social Skills to Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder - Kathleen Taylor, Orl/L, Marci Laurel, Ma, Ccc-Slp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Social Engagement &amp; the Steps to Being Social is a unique, visual and easy to use model that was developed to guide assessment and intervention across severity levels and age groups for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This user friendly book defines social engagement in observable language and breaks down social skills into a series of clearly defined steps. Each step is further broken down into pivotal skills that can be taught directly, and matched with evidence based practices to support teaching and learning. Case studies help illuminate concepts discussed at each step and sample activities are provided to support immediate real-world application.  Readers will have access to a practical model that supports the teaching of social skills, including:  •	A structured framework for social development that shows how one skill builds on another •	Sub-skills to provide specific direction for skills to teach •	An assessment to determine where treatment should begin and for monitoring progress •	Links to specific evidence based practices connected to the skill sets of the model •	A Social Plan that can be used as a tool for bridging assessment to specific treatment goals •	Case studies of individuals of varying ages and abilities •	Sample activities for promoting social development  Co-authors Kathleen &quot;Mo&quot; Taylor and Marci Laurel have been working and teaching together for the past 25 years. Together they have developed this model based on their work with individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families who have guided the process every step of the way. Mo and Marci have had the opportunity to present Social Engagement &amp; the Steps to Being Social in New Mexico, nationally and internationally and have been excited and humbled by the many family members and professionals who have found the work of use in home, school, university and clinical settings." />
