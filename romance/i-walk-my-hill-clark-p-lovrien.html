  <title>I Walk My Hill - Clark P. Lovrien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Walk My Hill is a family story spanning five generations. Part One begins with Samuel Lovering setting out to live on his own at age 17 just before the Revolutionary War. Using real family genealogy and a variety of historical research on the life and times of our ancestors through the generations, the author brings the past to life once more with this semi-fictional re-telling, at once both historically interesting and emotionally engaging. This segment of the story shows depictions of New England factory life (Mill Girls), the hunting and fur trade, farm life in Vermont and several key battles of the American Revolution. Natural hardships are overcome, unexpected losses are endured and the survivors are left putting the pieces together, looking for a reason to carry on. Though based on a real family descending from the &quot;Lovering&quot; namesake, this could very well be any American family and its founding descendants. Perhaps best of all, it reminds us that each family history is really an ongoing love story." />
