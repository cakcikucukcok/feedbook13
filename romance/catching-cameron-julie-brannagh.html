  <title>Catching Cameron - Julie Brannagh</title>

Ever. She tangled with one years ago, and it did not end well. Been there, done that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Cameron comes face-to-face with the very man who shattered her heart&amp;#8212;on camera, no less&amp;#8212;her world is upended for a second time by recklessly handsome Seattle Shark Zach Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zach has never been able to forget the gorgeous blonde who stole his breath away when he was still just a rookie. They&amp;#39;ve managed to give each other a wide berth for years, but when their jobs suddenly bring them together again and again, he knows he has to face his past once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because as they spend more time together, he becomes less focused on the action on the field and more concerned with catching Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;" />
