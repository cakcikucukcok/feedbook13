  <title>Something Seems Strange: Critical Essays on Christianity, Public Policy, and Contemporary Culture - Anthony B. Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life happens at the intersection of faith and culture. Whether we are Christians or not, we all have some narrative about the way the world ought to be that shapes how we view the world and live our lives. In this book, Anthony Bradley explores those intersections in ways that analyze and direct our imaginations toward the best practices that lead to human flourishing. Economics, political philosophy, sociology, psychology, and theology are just a few of the disciplines used in an attempt to make sense of a world where things are not the way they are supposed to be. Something does seem strange about the world, but we are not left without tools and principles that we need to make life work at the intersections of faith and culture. The aim of Something Seems Strange is to provide a model of thinking about life at those intersections, so that people can lively freely according to their God-given design." />
