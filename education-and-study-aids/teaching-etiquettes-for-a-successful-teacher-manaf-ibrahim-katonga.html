  <title>Teaching Etiquettes for a Successful Teacher - Manaf Ibrahim Katonga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Education is the heart of a successful nation. A learning nation is a successful nation. The nation that fails to educate its citizens faces numerous challenges such as social problems, financial problems, and rebellion. But for the success of education there should be enough and good teachers to teach students. In many countries, the number of good teachers is diminishing as the teaching career is becoming less attractive to a number of students because of the problems that are associated to teaching. It is imperative for the governments to come up with measures to increase the number of teachers in schools. It is unchallenged that teachers are one of the vital elements of education system. Therefore they need to be motivated and retained. Furthermore, the education system can be effective if the students are prepared to learn. It is very difficult for the teachers to impart knowledge to students that have barriers of education such as poor behavior. Therefore, parents have an important role to play to ensure that students come to school prepared to learn and without any barriers to education. It is the responsibility of the government and organizations to retain and motivate teachers. Systems of education will be successful if they are supported by the government, organizations, communities, parents, learners, and teachers. There should be good structures in the education system to produce more teachers who will be responsible in educating the nation. The death of a good system of education would drive the nation back to a time of ignorance where uneducated people will become leaders of nations." />
