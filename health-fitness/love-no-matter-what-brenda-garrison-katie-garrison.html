  <title>Love No Matter What - Brenda Garrison, Katie Garrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;How will you respond when your child makes a decision you don&#39;t agree with?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Parents and kids will never agree on everything but what can mom and dad do when that decision—whether a matter of preference, spirituality, or morality—is something they think is totally wrong? Author and speaker Brenda Garrison knows all too well that how parents respond will either build a wall or a bridge between them and their child.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brenda and her husband were forced to answer this question when their oldest daughter Katie abruptly moved out of the house with no means of support. It was not an illegal or immoral decision, but it was one that wasn&#39;t good for her. Their determination to keep an open door of communication is documented not only by their story, but by comments from Katie in each chapter as she offers insights from her own perspective.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also included are other family scenarios—everything from matters of preference to foolish, immoral, and even illegal decisions—as well as insights into different styles of parenting such as servant, checked-out, gotcha, scared, and controlling parents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With practical tips and relatable stories, Brenda shares how to model God&#39;s parenting style and explains the difference between the parent&#39;s responsibilities and the child&#39;s, then helps mom and dad discover ways to develop and nurture a relationship with their child that will last a lifetime.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
