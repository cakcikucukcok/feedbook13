  <title>Amari and the Princess - Magdalene Attah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This literary work by MAGDALENE OTUNSHA ATTAH reflects the purity of thought and the innocence by which a child sees through the environment. Magdalene Otunsha Attah, at the young age of 12 has translated her short life experiences into a book AMARI and the PRINCESS, and that puts her in the enviable league of Child Prodigies with an eye for the future.
The book, AMARI AND THE PRINCESS is a compilation of short stories, thematic in structure and captivating in its simplicity. The setting, the rural simplicity of a village life shows her passion not only for literature but for life in its purest natural form free from the manipulations of modern life.
This voracious reader leaves no one in doubt that this is just her beginning and that she has a lot more to offer to the literary world in the fullness of time.
Amari and the Princess is a story of the folly in treachery, reward for humility, and how steadfast honesty eventually led to the triumph over poverty by the lowly. 
The book is a must read for every child and any parent desirous of raising a complete child.
