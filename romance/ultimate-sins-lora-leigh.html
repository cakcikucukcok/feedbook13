      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three men, bound by blood, will stop at nothing to protect the women who have stolen their hearts and who they have claimed as their own-no matter what the price.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A FORBIDDEN LOVE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Ex-Marine Crowe Callahan has only had one obsession in life: Amelia Sorenson. She is the only one who has ever gotten under his skin. However, she is also the daughter of his family&#39;s sworn enemy: a man who has sought to destroy the Callahans for generations in order to further his own nefarious agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A DANGEROUS FATE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When Amelia put herself on Crowe&#39;s side and in Crowe&#39;s bed, she became her father&#39;s enemy as well. When Wayne Sorenson escapes capture, both Amelia and Crowe know it is only a matter of time before he resurfaces to exact his revenge. Now Crowe will claim Amelia in order to bait a killer and end things once and for all. But can he protect the woman he can&#39;t seem to live without from one of the deadliest enemies he has ever known? And will he survive if he can&#39;t? in Ultimate Sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Leigh&#39;s books can scorch the ink off the page.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times BOOKreviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
