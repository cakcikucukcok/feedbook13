      <meta name="description" content="Carolyn&#39;s first love is back and not only has she returned to Steven but to her old job and she doesn&#39;t know why she ever left. Robert must have been a mistake and ever if she can&#39;t help but think of him, her mind is firmly on making things right with Steven. Carolyn realizes that her new found infamy is not going to fade away for a while, especially when Robert makes a declaration about their relationship and its published for the whole world to read. Carolyn hears the story of his half-brother, an underhanded, scheming man who has been his rival since birth, he and his ex-wife Angela hatched a plan to help themselves to the family fortune and Robert&#39;s heart was the only thing in their way. Will Carolyn forget about Steven but being in Robert&#39;s arms? To avoid hurting her first love, will Carolyn decided to stay with Steven instead? Will Carolyn come clean with Robert about the night that happened in the apartment with Steven or she will continue with her lie?" />
