  <title>The Last Place God Made - Michael M. Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Nicholas Madrid, Tucson private investigator, thought he had seen it all, but his most bizarre case yet begins when dark-haired, long-legged Lucia Calderon asks Nick to find her missing little brother. What Nick ultimately finds, will change the &quot;Old Pueblo&quot; forever.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	The puzzling mystery begins with a girl who is killed twice! Was Cindy Dexter killed during a cult ritual, or was she murdered to cover up an even more heinous crime?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Cindy&#39;s murder also triggers a macabre chain of events that include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	- the murders of three innocent people;	&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	- the discovery of an efficient, high-profit drug smuggling ring;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	- the unholy activities of a Satanic cult linked directly to organized crime; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	- and the shattering revelation that some of the city&#39;s most powerful and influential businessmen belong to a secret society of pedophiles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	On the trail of a frightened teenager, coerced into participating in a ritualistic murder, Nick delves deeper and deeper into a labyrinthine cobweb of treacherous lies, deception, and brutal murders. Before he can prove a naive boy&#39;s innocence, Nick must first unravel a nightmarish maze that stretches from the mayor&#39;s office to the seedy back alleys of Tucson--the sunshine land of saguaros, roadrunners, and retirees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	After Lucia Calderon is kidnapped, Nick is forced into a violent confrontation with one of the drug world&#39;s most ruthless and deadliest drug emperors, a Colombian named Santiago Robles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	In order to save his beautiful client&#39;s life, Nick Madrid must journey to a desolate, forgotten Arizona town, Ultimo Lugar, perched on the Mexican border--a forbidden drug smuggler&#39;s haven that lies between heaven and hell and is sagely referred to by the locals as...THE LAST PLACE GOD MADE.&lt;/P&gt;" />
