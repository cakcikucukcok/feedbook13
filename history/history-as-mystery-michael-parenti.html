  <title>History as Mystery - Michael Parenti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lively challenge to mainstream history, Michael Parenti does battle with a number of mass-marketed historical myths. He shows how history&#39;s victors distort and suppress the documentary record in order to perpetuate their power and privilege. And he demonstrates how historians are influenced by the professional and class environment in which they work. Pursuing themes ranging from antiquity to modern times, from the Inquisition and Joan of Arc to the anti-labor bias of present-day history books, &lt;I&gt;History as Mystery&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates how past and present can inform each other and how history can be a truly exciting and engaging subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Michael Parenti, always provocative and eloquent, gives us a lively as well as valuable critique of orthodoxy posing as &amp;#145;history.&amp;#8217;&quot;&amp;#151;Howard Zinn, author of &lt;I&gt;A People&#39;s History of the United States&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Deserves to become an instant classic.&quot; &amp;#151;Bertell Ollman, author of &lt;I&gt;Dialectical Investigations&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who keep secret the past, and lie about it, condemn us to repeat it. Michael Parenti unveils the history of falsified history, from the early Christian church to the present: a fascinating, darkly revelatory tale.&quot; &amp;#151;Daniel Ellsberg, author of &lt;I&gt;The Pentagon Papers&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Solid if surely controversial stuff.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Kirkus&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Parenti, PhD Yale, is an internationally known author and lecturer. He is one of the nation&#39;s leadiing progressive political analysts.
