  <title>The Man in the Wooden Hat - Jane Gardam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Two in Jane Gardam&#39;s Old Filth Trilogy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New York Times called Sir Edward Feathers one of the most memorable characters in modern literature. A lyrical novel that recalls his fully lived life, &lt;i&gt;Old Filth&lt;/i&gt; has been acclaimed as Jane Gardam?s masterpiece, a book where life and art merge. And now that beautiful, haunting novel has been joined by a companion that also bursts with humor and wisdom: &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Wooden Hat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Old Filth&lt;/i&gt; was Eddie?s story. &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Wooden Hat&lt;/i&gt; is the history of his marriage told from the perspective of his wife, Betty, a character as vivid and enchanting as Filth himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They met in Hong Kong after the war. Betty had spent the duration in a Japanese internment camp. Filth was already a successful barrister, handsome, fast becoming rich, in need of a wife but unaccustomed to romance. A perfect English couple of the late 1940s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As a portrait of a marriage, with all the bittersweet secrets and surprising fulfillment of the 50-year union of two remarkable people, the novel is a triumph. &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Wooden Hat&lt;/i&gt; is fiction of a very high order from a great novelist working at the pinnacle of her considerable power. It will be read and loved and recommended by all the many thousands of readers who found its predecessor, &lt;i&gt;Old Filth&lt;/i&gt;, so compelling and so thoroughly satisfying." />
