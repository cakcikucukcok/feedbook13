  <title>TUFTY RIQUET - A French Children’s Fairy Tale About the Fallacy of Beauty - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 299&lt;br /&gt;
In this 299th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the French Fairy Tale &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;TUFTY RIQUET&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away there was, once upon a time, a Queen gave birth to a son, so hideously ugly, that it was long disputed, whether he had human form. A Fairy, who was at his birth, affirmed, he would be very lovable for all that, since he should be endowed with abundance of wit. She even added, that it would be in his power, by virtue of a gift she had just then given him, to bestow on the person he most loved as much wit as he pleased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All this somewhat comforted the poor Queen, who was under a grievous affliction for having brought into the world such an ugly brat. It is true, that this child no sooner began to prattle, but he said a thousand pretty things, and that in all his actions there was something so taking, that he charmed every-body. I forgot to tell you, that he came into the world with a little tuft of hair upon his head, which made them call him TUFTY RIQUET, for Riquet was the family name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seven or eight years after this, the Queen of a neighbouring kingdom was delivered of two daughters at a birth. The first-born of these was beautiful beyond compare, whereat the Queen was so very glad, that those present were afraid that her excess of joy would do her harm. The same Fairy, who had assisted at the birth of little TUFTY RIQUET, was here also; and, to moderate the Queen&amp;#39;s gladness, she declared, that this little Princess should have no wit at all, but be as stupid as she was pretty. This mortified the Queen extremely, but some moments afterwards she had far greater sorrow; for, the second daughter she was delivered of, was very ugly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do not afflict yourself so much, Madam,&amp;quot; said the Fairy; &amp;quot;your daughter shall have so great a portion of wit, that her want of beauty will scarcely be perceived.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;God grant it,&amp;quot; replied the Queen; &amp;quot;but is there no way to make the eldest, who is so pretty, have some little wit?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I can do nothing for her, Madam, as to wit,&amp;quot; answered the Fairy, &amp;quot;but everything as to beauty; and as there is nothing but what I would do for your satisfaction, I give her for gift, that she shall have the power to make handsome the person who shall best please her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
So what happened next? Did Prince Tufty Riquet and the princesses ever get together? What happened when they did? Was Cupid able to fire his arrows of love? If he did who became love-struck? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this story to get the answers to your questions and find out just what happened.&lt;br /&gt;
