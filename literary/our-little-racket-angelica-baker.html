  <title>Our Little Racket - Angelica Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A captivating debut about wealth, envy, and secrets: the story of five women whose lives are dramatically changed by the downfall of a financial titan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 15, 2008, the world of Greenwich, Connecticut, is shaken. When the investment bank Weiss &amp;#38; Partners is shuttered, CEO Bob D&amp;#8217;Amico must fend off allegations of malfeasance, as well as the judgment and resentment of his community. As panic builds, five women in his life must scramble to negotiate power on their own terms and ask themselves what &amp;#8212;if anything&amp;#8212;is worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of this collapse, Bob D&amp;#8217;Amico&amp;#8217;s teenage daughter Madison begins to probe her father&amp;#8217;s heretofore secret world for information. Four other women in Madison&amp;#8217;s life &amp;#8212;her mother Isabel, her best friend Amanda, her nanny Lily, and family friend Mina &amp;#8212;begin to question their own shifting roles in their insular, moneyed world.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the adults, this means learning how to protect their own in a community that has turned against them. For the younger generation, it means heightened rebellion and heartache during the already volatile teenage years. And for Lily, it means deciding where her loyalties lie when it comes to the family in which she is both an essential member and, ultimately, an outsider.&amp;#160; All these women have witnessed more than they&amp;#8217;ve disclosed, all harbor secret insecurities and fears, and all must ask themselves&amp;#8212;where is the line between willful ignorance and unspoken complicity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With astonishing precision, insight, and grace, Angelica Baker weaves a timeless social novel about the rituals of intimacy and community; of privilege and information; of family and risk; of etiquette and taboo.&lt;/p&gt;" />
