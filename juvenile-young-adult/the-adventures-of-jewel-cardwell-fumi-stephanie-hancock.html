  <title>The Adventures of Jewel Cardwell - Fumi Stephanie Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Free-spirited and more than a little rebellious, seventeen-year-old Jewel Cardwell isnt too thrilled when she gains admission to Grayton Preparatory School, a prestigious, girls-only, top-notch private institution nestled in the South African farmlands of Limpopo. Unfortunately, its a move that will change her life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost from the moment she arrives, a string of misfortunes and strange occurrences begin trailing her. The comforts of home have been swept away, and she is plunged into a world where she has to fend for herself. But that pales in comparison to what happens on the nights when theres a full moon. Dark forces swirl during those nights and turn up in the form of hideous monsters and frightening demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Jewel has always been drawn to the darker side of life, this is more than she bargained for. Shes also caught between two boys: Darwin Morton, a lad shes known growing up, and Eric Broder, a soccer team leader with a silver spoon in his mouth. Why her love life has to get interesting now is a question she cant answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to it all may be in her grandmothers locket, which Jewel always wears. Will Jewel be able to solve the mystery before evil is unleashed against those she loves?&lt;/p&gt;" />
