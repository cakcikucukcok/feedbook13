  <title>One Man’S Life and Thoughts - Charles T. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no one that can promise that tomorrow will even come, 
And there is no guarantee at all that we will see tomorrows sun. 
The promise of another day is not a guarantee things will change, 
In fact there is no guarantee that there are any days that remain. 
Then what value is there in today if tomorrow may never come, 
Why worry about a day not here when our present one isnt done. 
We should focus on the present and treat each hour as if the best, 
For times a gift he loans to us when it is gone we have none left. 
For once its gone its truly lost, not one minute can be returned, 
The values in how we used it, and most important what we learned. 
So if were frugal with our time, and use it to learn about his way, 
He will reward us with additional time in the form of another day. 
But remember time is still Gods gift; it has value and great worth, 
A tool hed have us use to learn about his wisdom here on earth. 
So each moment that he gives to u, is ours to try to be like him. 
But if we squander what he gives, well not have that time again." />
