  <title>The Gnome&#39;s Eye - Anna Kerz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the spring of 1954, when her father announces that the family has a chance to immigrate to Canada, Theresa&#39;s life changes forever. She and her family are wartime refugees from Yugoslavia, so it shouldn&#39;t be hard to leave Austria. But the weathered barracks of Lager Lichtenstein are the only home she knows, and they are filled with family and friends she doesn&#39;t want to leave behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As she says her good-byes, Theresa&#39;s friend Martin gives her two gifts: a package of postcards and a stone he calls the Gnome&#39;s Eye, which he says will &quot;protect her from all things evil, living or dead.&quot; Theresa is convinced the stone has no power, but she still keeps it close as they travel on the crowded immigrant ship and when they settle into a rooming house on Kensington Avenue in Toronto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At first Theresa is afraid of everything: the other tenants in the rooming house, the rat that lives in the kitchen, learning a new language. But as time goes by, Theresa&#39;s need for the Gnome&#39;s Eye fades, until she is finally able to give it to someone who needs it more than she does." />
