  <title>Trance - Christopher Sorrentino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1974: A tiny band of self-styled urban guerrillas, calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army, abducts a newspaper heiress, who then abruptly announces that she has adopted the guerrilla name &quot;Tania&quot; and chosen to remain with her former captors. Has she been brainwashed? Coerced? Could she be sincere? Why would such a nice girl disavow her loving parents, her adoring fiancé, her comfortable home? Why would she suddenly adopt the SLA&#39;s cri de coeur, &quot;Death to the Fascist Insect that Preys Upon the Life of the People&quot;? Soon most of the SLA are dead, killed in a suicidal confrontation with police in Los Angeles, forcing Tania and her two remaining comrades--the pompous and abusive General Teko and his duplicitous lieutenant, Yolanda--into hiding, where they will remain for the next sixteen months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trance&lt;/i&gt;, Christopher Sorrentino&#39;s mesmerizing and brilliant second novel, traces this fugitive period, leading the reader on a breathtaking, hilarious, and heartbreaking underground tour across a beleaguered America, in the company of scam artists, visionaries, cultists, and a mismatched gang of middle-class people who typify the guiding conceit of their time, that of self-renovation. Along the way he tells the story of a nation divided against itself--parents and children, men and women, black and white; a story of hidebound tradition and radical change, of truth and propaganda, of cynicism and idealism; a story as transfixing and relevant today as it was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insightful, compassionate, scathingly funny, and moving, &lt;i&gt;Trance&lt;/i&gt; is a virtuoso performance, placing Christopher Sorrentino in the first rank of American novelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trance&lt;/i&gt; is a 2005 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
