  <title>The Making of a Marine-Scholar - Dr. George A. Baker Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. George A. Baker III&lt;/b&gt; distinguished himself both as a marine and educator; in this memoir, he looks back at a long life dedicated to serving others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his boyhood in Sumter, South Carolina, to entering the service during the Cold War to his experiences on the battlefield, Baker examines his actions and those of others with refreshing honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a confidante and contemporary to high-ranking military men, presidents, and Washington insiders, Bakers ascension through the military ranks allowed him to witness and analyze political and social changes from a unique perspective. He ultimately rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and his perspective of the Cold War, Vietnam, and politics provided him with a strong foundation to excel in his second career as an educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker draws upon his experiences as a soldier, tactician, and teacher to share a theory of leadership that can be applied in various settings. Numerous vignettes offer powerful learning opportunities in various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Making of a Marine-Scholar&lt;/i&gt;, discover untold history as well as what it really means to serve your country and fellow man. Baker presents a blueprint for living a rewarding life that has purpose and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
