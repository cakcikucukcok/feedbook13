  <title>My Time - Bradley Wiggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On July 22, 2012, Bradley Wiggins made history as the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. Ten days later, at the London Olympic Games, he won the time trial to become his country&#39;s most decorated Olympian. In an instant, &quot;Wiggo&quot;--now Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins--became a national hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years previously, however, Wiggins had been staring into the abyss. His much-hyped attempt to conquer the 2010 Tour de France had ended in public humiliation. Poor results and indifferent form left him facing release from Team Sky. And then he was hit with the tragic news of the death of his grandfather, George, the man who had raised him as a young boy. At rock bottom, Wiggins had to reach deep inside and find the strength to fight his way back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outspoken, honest, intelligent, and fearless, Wiggins has been hailed as the people&#39;s champion. In &lt;i&gt;My Time&lt;/i&gt;, he tells the story of the remarkable journey that led him from his lowest ebb to win the world&#39;s toughest race. He opens up about the personal anguish that has driven him on and what it&#39;s like behind the scenes at Team Sky: the brutal training regimes, the sacrifices, and his views on his teammates and rivals. He talks too about his anger at the specter of doping that pursues his sport, how he dealt with the rush of taking Olympic gold, and above all what it takes to be the greatest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
