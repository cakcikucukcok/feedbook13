  <title>Access to Dominion - Lord Harrison Bolorunfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="And God blessed them and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth (Gen. 1:28).
The Lord said to me, Harrison, I have given you dominion. I did not say I will give you dominion, but I said I have given you dominion.
Dominion!
What is dominion? The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines it as authority to rule; control (the right of directing or of giving orders; power or authority) over something.
So dominion is the same word as authority, power to reign on this earth over every situation. I therefore announce it to the whole world, God has given me authority, power to reign on this earth over every situations. I do not doubt it because God said it to me verbatim.
No man can reign on earth without dominion or authority. Just like no king can rule without authority or power; where the word of a king is, there is power. A king that has no dominion over his kingdom is no more a king, the same way a believer that has no dominion on earth cannot reign as a king." />
