  <title>River Rover Chronicles - Joyce Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some places along the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers, as well as Spring Creek and Lake Seminole, saw more human drama than others. Many events happened along these banks amid the tangle of underbrush and marsh grasses. Many spirits still roam the thick forests of sheltering oaks and pines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the clandestine happenings are now under the water. Exposing these mysteries and bringing them out into the brilliant sun, they can be studied and finally put these spirits to rest. River Rover Chronicles does this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Among the stories are:&lt;br&gt;
Archaeological find, four villages stacked on top of one another, dating back to 8000 BC and up to AD 1400&lt;br&gt;
Apalachicola Fort, believed to be the first fortification built here&lt;br&gt;
Neal&#39;s Landing, site of Indian battles and steamboat wrecks&lt;br&gt;
Parramore&#39;s Landing, a boom town that caused its own demise&lt;br&gt;
Fort Scott, an army defense post where most soldiers came to tragic ends&lt;br&gt;
Devil&#39;s Playground, encounter spirits there&lt;br&gt;
Civil War gunboat, built on the Chattahoochee River&lt;br&gt;
Spring Creek, home to prehistoric burial site, a sacred place for Indians and a structure where soldiers found shelter&lt;br&gt;
Aging power dam, arising from the water, begging to tell its stories&lt;br&gt;
Fiery explosions on the rivers&lt;br&gt;
Steamboat Janie Rae, known for mysterious deaths&lt;br&gt;
The Thress States, did this steamboat really run over a corpse?&lt;br&gt;
Steamboat Mary, renowned for the treasure that went down with the ship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;River Rover Chronicles takes you into the present, with a guide to finding all boat landings and parks in the Lake Seminole area, either by vehicle or boat, each listed with amenities. Also, a guide to waterfront restaurants, boats repair shops, and where there is fuel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
