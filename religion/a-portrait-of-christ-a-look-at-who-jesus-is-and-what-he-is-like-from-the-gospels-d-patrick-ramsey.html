  <title>A Portrait of Christ: A Look at Who Jesus Is and What He Is Like from the Gospels - D. Patrick Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is Jesus like? What kind of a person is he? Is he emotional or stoic? Is he proud or humble? Is he aloof or friendly? This book attempts to answer these types of questions. After demonstrating that Jesus is the promised Christ and that he is both divine and human, this book examines Jesus&#39; personal characteristics as they are displayed in the four Gospels. The four Gospels are clearly not a typical biography of Jesus. Nonetheless, they do provide an informative account of his life here on earth, from which we can discover what he is like as a person." />
