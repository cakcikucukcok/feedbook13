  <title>Lady Bane - Richard Jay Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enter first, Dr. Arnold Baumcort interviewing three Ladies of the Evening as research for a magazine article. His purpose is not to create prurient interest but to tell of the humor and pathos found in their unusual work and of their plans for retirement when age calls their number.
Shortly after publishing his article on the lovely Cheryl, Gypsy, and Mitzi, Arnold is called upon to rescue Gypsy from a knife-wielding attacker. She has temporarily escaped and turned to Dr. Baumcort rather than the police. Involving the police would produce harmful publicity. Arnold takes her in for a time and promises to keep her safe.
Before long, Arnold feels that the three ladies must live under a dark cloud of blight as he is phoned next by tearful Mitzi. Ive been robbed of my retirement savings by my investment adviser.
Arnold cannot refuse helping and contacts Phil Malloy. Detective Malloy is an investigator often called upon by divorce attorneys to obtain evidence on straying husbands or wives. He refuses a few cases.
Phil Malloy has just backed away and turned over a possible International murder case to the FBI. He is free to take Arnolds case to track down the investment adviser and Mitzis retirement funds. Malloy and his comely assistant, Sheba, go into a full court press. With clever detective work, Malloy is finally led to the exciting conclusion." />
