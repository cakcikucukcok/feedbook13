  <title>Student Revolt - Matt Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whatever happened to the student revolt? In 2010 young people across Britain took to the streets to defy a wave of government attacks on education, increasing tuition fees, and cuts to grants for college students. Months of occupations, ‘kettling’ and outbreaks of violence ensued, but to what effect? Today, students face new attacks on higher education from the current Conservative government. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Student Revolt tells the story of the year that introduced a generation to the power of the mass movement, through the voices of the people involved. Activists’, students’, university-occupiers’, young workers’ and politicians’ testimonies are woven together to create a narrative which starkly captures both the deep divisions as well as the intense energy that sprung from its actors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ‘Millbank Generation’ has since moved on – some fell into political inactivity – but many went on to explore different forms of politics, where they continue to fight. This book will provide poignant reminder of the revolt for today’s activists, as well as an opportunity to reflect on its many lessons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published in partnership with the Left Book Club." />
