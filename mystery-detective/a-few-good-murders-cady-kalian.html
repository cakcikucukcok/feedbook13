  <title>A Few Good Murders - Cady Kalian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maggie Mars is a struggling screenwriter whose big break is happening now. Her latest script is being filmed and Maggie&#39;s on the set. But Maggie thinks that the lead actress is playing her character all wrong and tells her. A screaming match ensues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when said actress is found dead with her head bashed in with her own Oscar, Maggie is viewed as a &quot;person of interest&quot;. She tries to keep a low profile and cooperate with the police. Complicating things is the fact that one of the deputies on the case is a former lover of Joe Camanetti, the sometime/longtime love of Maggie&#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And somewhere out there is a killer who thinks Maggie is just too clever for her own good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memo #312 to Maggie: Never write murder scenarios too good for a killer to pass up...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
