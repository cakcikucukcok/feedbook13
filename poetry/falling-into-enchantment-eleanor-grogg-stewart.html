  <title>Falling Into Enchantment - Eleanor Grogg Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although Eleanor Grogg Stewart has written poetry for many years, she did not choose to publish for two reasons: first, she thinks that poetry is meant to be heard; and second, she was a teacher of college freshmen for forty-odd years and some of the poems did not seem appropriate for her students to read—perhaps an old-fashioned point of view. She thinks differently now, so here they are. Already published is a non-fiction work telling the story of her time as a teacher for Vietnamese “boat people” in a UNHCR first asylum refugee camp on Palawan Island in the Philippines from 1981 to1983. This was the most extraordinary experience of her life, and the book has helped her to reconnect with Vietnamese people who are now living full lives in many different countries." />
