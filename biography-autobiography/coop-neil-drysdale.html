  <title>COOP - Neil Drysdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Davie Cooper was without doubt one of Scotland&#39;s greatestever footballers, a man who excited and entertained crowds across the globe, whether with Rangers or Scotland, or later in his career, as part of Motherwell&#39;s 1991 Scottish Cup-winning side. He relished the big stage and although he unquestionably had the ability to play at any level, he always preferred to stay true to his roots as a local hero in the West of Scotland. Tragically, his life was cut short in 1995 when this larger-thanlife character who had enjoyed an incredible career died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage at the age of just thirty-nine. Now, in Coop, author Neil Drysdale examines the life of this sporting idol and includes exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in football, including Sir Alex Ferguson, Gordon Smith, Craig Brown, Tom Boyd, Bobby Russell and Andy Roxburgh. But it also gives the fans who applauded his talents at Rangers, Motherwell and Clydebank the chance to pay homage to his myriad gifts and to remember his astonishing talents. Engrossing, insightful and entertaining, Coop is the story of a true star and a heartfelt portrait of a man who was taken from us far too soon." />
