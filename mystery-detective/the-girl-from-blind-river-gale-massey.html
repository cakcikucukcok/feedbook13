  <title>The Girl From Blind River - Gale Massey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gritty tale of how far we’ll go to protect the ones we love for fans of Daniel Woodrell’s &lt;i&gt;Winter’s Bone&lt;/i&gt; and Emma Cline’s &lt;i&gt;The Girls&lt;/i&gt; from Gale Massey, a talented new name in crime fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Everyone says the Elders family are nothing but cheats, thieves, and convicts—a fact nineteen-year old Jamie Elders has been trying desperately to escape. She may have the natural talent of a poker savant, but her dreams of going pro and getting the hell out of the tiny town of Parsons, New York are going nowhere fast. Especially once she lands in a huge pile of debt to her uncle Loyal. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At Loyal’s beck and call until her debt is repaid, Jamie can’t easily walk away—not with her younger brother Toby left at his mercy. So when Loyal demands Jamie’s help cleaning up a mess late one night, she has no choice but to agree. But disposing of a dead man and covering up his connection to the town’s most powerful judge goes beyond family duty. When it comes out that the victim was a beloved athlete and Loyal pins the murder on Toby, only Jamie can save him. But with a dogged detective on her trail and her own future at stake, she’ll have to decide: embrace her inner criminal, or defy it—and face the consequences. &lt;/div&gt;" />
