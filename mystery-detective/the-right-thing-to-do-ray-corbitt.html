  <title>The Right Thing to Do - Ray Corbitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandra Davis, an employee with the federal governments Affordable Health Care Program, is in a deadly catch 22 situation: Keep quiet and continue to do her job or tell the truth, save thousands of lives and be killed for going public.  Her death would be ruled a tragic case of overwork, exhaustion and despairif not for the letters she sent out to 13 people.  Sandra has a terrible secret, and now, her secret is shared by several carefully selected letter holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the passage of the Healthcare Act, the United States has changed. The powers-that-be have too much power, but nobody knows ituntil now. Sandras letters reach their intended recipients, and so begins a series of mysterious murders that stump authorities. Someone with great influence is killing off everyone who received a letter from Sandra, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-doctors in Washington are quick to cover up anything that might cast their operation in an unfavorable light, and they are good at their jobs, even when their job involves murder. Still, there are those willing to fight back: survivors who know what theyre up against. They will reveal Sandras truth at any cost in order to protect the American people, despite the threat of death and dishonor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
