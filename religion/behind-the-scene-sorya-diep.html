  <title>Behind the Scene - Sorya Diep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book takes place in three countries: Cambodia, Thailand, and United States of America. It is about how God has been good to me: before I knew him, when I first got to know him, and now that I am walking under his guidance. 
Paragraph 1: Before I Knew God (in the Killing Field) 
They are going to kill me in two days. One of the killers, we never met before. He could not rest. He came to me three times that day to tell me what I should do and what his plan was. I did escape successfully with the help of a nice and kind unknown person who was willing to put himself at risk to save me. 
I was at the care center. There are only two patients, the first-class citizen lady and me. She cannot sleep, and I cannot lie down to sleep. The day that they made the decision to kill me, she is the one who spoke for me and saved my life. What made these three people turn around and risk themselves to save my life? 
Paragraph 2: Introduced to Lord Jesus (in the Refugee Camp) 
I was injured by the bomb and was in the hospital for more than two months. At the lowest time in life, I was introduced to God by a Seventh Day Adventist missionary who brought slides about Lord Jesus to the ward where I stayed and by the group of healing service. 
Paragraph 3: Walking by faith (in United States of America) 
I was baptized at the end of 1994 after the Lord spoke to me out loud, Sorya! Its time for you to get baptized. Since then he has always watched over me and my family. He protected us, provided for us, blessed us, healed us, carried us, led us, guided us, gave us miracle after miracle. He let me hear his voice from time to time. He gave me visions and more. 
Walking by Faith is written in eighty-eight chapters. Each chapter has one page telling of what God has done for my family and my life, either a miracle of healing or calling for fasting or foretelling what is going to happen, a vision, or just about how God supernaturally answered our prayers, backed up with verses in the Bible. 
Conclusion: This book is not a story. It is a testimony about how good God is. How real, how powerful, and how merciful he is. This book is simply written to give God glory for all he has done for my family and me and to give others hope in God or to reconsider their faith. 
If you find in your heart that it is your call to help to make this book be used as a testimony for the world, please give our God the glory. 
Thank you! May God richly bless you in everything you do!" />
