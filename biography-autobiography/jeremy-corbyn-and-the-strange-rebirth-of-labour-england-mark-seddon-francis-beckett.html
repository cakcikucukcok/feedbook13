  <title>Jeremy Corbyn and the Strange Rebirth of Labour England - Mark Seddon, Francis Beckett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2016 Labour, led by the most left-wing leader that the party had ever seen, burst into new life. The Westminster beltway of political insiders, pollsters, commentators and newspaper proprietors were completely taken by surprise and left with egg all over their faces. Few took the trouble to ask how or why Labour, almost alone amongst parties on the left in Europe, had re-grouped, revived and successfully turned its back, so decisively on Tony Blair and Bill Clinton&#39;s &#39;third way&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour England wasn&#39;t dead. It had been sleeping. For thirty years it had been kicked into near oblivion, first by Margaret Thatcher and then by Tony Blair. That strange, sentimental, almost mystical mix of the trade unions, adult education institutes, powerful Labour councils, the local comprehensive school and the local Co-Op that sustained Labour governments for thirty years from the 1940s to the 1970s had been in retreat. Now, against all the odds, it was back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened? What will Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s Labour England look like? Francis Beckett and Mark Seddon are Labour insiders.  They know. And they say it will be an exciting and better place to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
