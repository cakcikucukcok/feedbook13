  <title>Tales from the Diamond City Social Club - Douglas Simpson, Dr. Shari Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What about this book? For one thing, at first look, it seems to be poorly organized. Granted, it does seem to be confusing. However, as disorganized as it appears to be, all four of the chapters are connected quite logically. 
All four of the chapters exist for one purpose: each one of the four has something important to say about why Diamond City is so unique and has a very bright future. The focus now is to make that bright future a reality. 
Chapter I: Let us consider the unique kind of people our residents are. For example, read this chapter and find out how our people demonstrated the strong humanitarian traits that are embedded in the folks of Diamond City. They are the core of Diamond City. 
Chapter II: This one is easy. It is connected to where prospective visitors need to go. In this chapter, there is an answer for any visitor and/or prospect that asks a question about any topic having to do with Diamond City. 
Chapter III: If you are looking to check out what is in Diamond City, you will have to do some research on our animals, especially those that may come to your property at any time of the day or night. This chapter has two animal tales to tell. One is about a real-life story of humans attempting to deal with three kinds of precocious animals. Find out who wins! The second animal tale is about intergroup relations between Canada geese, mallard ducks, migrant ducks, and one coot. It may cause you to compare their behavior with some humans you know. 
Chapter IV: Here we have done a favor for our prospects. They now have a source where they can find out firsthand from our residents what it is like to live in DC." />
