  <title>Developing a well-structured second wave by implementing long crossing moves and options for further playing (TU 13) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this training unit is to develop a long crossing during the second wave. Following a warm-up running exercise, a short game, and a ball familiarization exercise, the players initially develop the long crossing during the goalkeeper warm-up shooting phase. In the subsequent series of shots which will be combined with a 1-on-0 fast break, the players practice the long crossing with compensation of the center back player. Defense players and the pivot are added for the two subsequent small group exercises, before the players implement the course 4-on-4 during the closing part of the training unit.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 15 minutes/total time: 15 minutes)
- Short game (10/25)
- Ball familiarization (10/35)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/45)
- Offense/Series of shots (10/55)
- Offense/Small groups (15/70)
- Offense/Small groups (10/80)
- Closing game (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Difficulty: High level (youth teams under 17 years of age and adult teams)" />
