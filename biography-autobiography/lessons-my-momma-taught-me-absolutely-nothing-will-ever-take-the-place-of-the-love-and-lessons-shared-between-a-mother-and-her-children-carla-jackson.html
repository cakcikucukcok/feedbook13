  <title>Lessons My Momma Taught Me: Absolutely Nothing Will Ever Take the Place of the Love and Lessons Shared Between a Mother and Her Children - Carla Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Lessons My Momma Taught Me&quot; is the first book written by Carla Jackson. It is a memoir dedicated to her beautiful mother, Ora. In spite of enduring near insurmountable odds, Carla&#39;s mother managed to raise seven girls while teaching them the importance of putting God and family first as a pinnacle for the world to see and emulate. This memoir is laced with difficult and life changing lessons that helped shape Carla into the woman she&#39;s become today. Many of the lessons are intertwined with beautiful and heartfelt experiences which Carla and her siblings endured while growing up in Houston, Texas. Most of what she shares is centered around one of her mother&#39;s favorite scriptures, &quot;As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you...&quot; (Isaiah 66:13 NIV)" />
