  <title>The Wars of the Roosevelts - William J. Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The award-winning author presents a provocative, thoroughly modern revisionist biographical history of one of America&amp;#8217;s greatest and most influential families&amp;#8212;the Roosevelts&amp;#8212;exposing heretofore unknown family secrets and detailing complex family rivalries with his signature cinematic flair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on previously hidden historical documents and interviews with the long-silent &quot;illegitimate&quot; branch of the family, William J. Mann paints an elegant, meticulously researched, and groundbreaking group portrait of this legendary family. Mann argues that the Roosevelts&amp;#8217; rise to power and prestige was actually driven by a series of intense personal contest that at times devolved into blood sport. His compelling and eye-opening masterwork is the story of a family at war with itself, of social Darwinism at its most ruthless&amp;#8212;in which the strong devoured the weak and repudiated the inconvenient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann focuses on Eleanor Roosevelt, who, he argues, experienced this brutality firsthand, witnessing her Uncle Theodore cruelly destroy her father, Elliott&amp;#8212;his brother and bitter rival&amp;#8212;for political expediency. Mann presents a fascinating alternate picture of Eleanor, contending that this &quot;worshipful niece&quot; in fact bore a grudge against TR for the rest of her life, and dares to tell the truth about her intimate relationships without obfuscations, explanations, or labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann also brings into focus Eleanor&amp;#8217;s cousins, TR&amp;#8217;s children, whose stories propelled the family rivalry but have never before been fully chronicled, as well as her illegitimate half-brother, Elliott Roosevelt Mann, who inherited his family&amp;#8217;s ambition and skill without their name and privilege. Growing up in poverty just miles from his wealthy relatives, Elliott Mann embodied the American Dream, rising to middle-class prosperity and enjoying one of the very few happy, long-term marriages in the Roosevelt saga. For the first time, &lt;em&gt;The Wars of the Roosevelts&lt;/em&gt; also includes the stories of Elliott&amp;#8217;s daughter and grandchildren, and never-before-seen photographs from their archives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeply psychological and finely rendered, illustrated with sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs, &lt;em&gt;The Wars of the Roosevelts&lt;/em&gt; illuminates not only the enviable strengths but also the profound shame of this remarkable and influential family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
