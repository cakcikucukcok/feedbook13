  <title>Loving War - Shane A. Worley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does someone depict the subtleties of romance and love with words and pictures? Can we only describe what we, through experience and imagination, believe love to be? It is always a wonder why so many people do not really experience true love. Through gossip and television we paint a picture of what we think love should be and come to believe that as the truth. In this book, you will find a wide range of imaginative pictures translated into words which describe the authors experiences of love. 
	In war, destructive chaos, explosions of fire and dust settle at your feet; you have been entrusted to carry out missions and ensure the safety and security of your men. Painting the images of war through poetry helps us to define destiny. Fighting terrorism is a continuous battle and it is as difficult as chasing your shadow. Included in this volume is poetry that displays heroism, patriotism, and the love of service that many have forgotten. Within these pages, readers may find a treasure map in which the golden treasure is the remembrance of purpose." />
