      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jason Wilder was wounded in his last encounter with the bad guys, but he&#39;s back on the job and ready for another run-in. He&#39;s just about to close up the private investigation office owned by his mother, Victoria, for the night, when an elderly man enters. His name is Elijah Messenger and he says someone is trying to kill him. Jason gives him a polite brush-off, but the next morning he learns that the old man has indeed been murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a morning full of trouble. The mayor arrives asking Victoria for help. His daughter has become involved with a group of &quot;devil worshippers&quot; and he wants her pried loose. When Mom learns that the group was from Messenger&#39;s church, she turns the case over to Jason, but, as always, keeps out a maternal eye. &lt;br&gt;Investigating the case forces Jason to juggle two relationships: a loving one with a beautiful single mother and a less-than-civil one with Police Officer Lori Banks, also referred to as &quot;the Beast.&quot; If he can do that and avoid any more knife wounds, he&#39;ll be in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Siverling&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Sorcerer&#39;s Circle &lt;/i&gt;offers another exciting private-eye novel, filled with the unique characters and stellar writing of his debut.&lt;/p&gt;" />
