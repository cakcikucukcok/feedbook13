  <title>Pan&#39;s Conquest - Aubrie Dionne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pan&#39;s Conquest by Aubrie Dionne &quot;A delightful tale of love lost and found again-- and of Gods who must learn to grow beyond their fates. Highly recommended!&quot;--Tiffany Allee Syrinx pulled a fast one on Pan to escape his raging lust. The God of Chastity wasn&#39;t about to break her vows and succumb to his temptations. Transported to the twenty-first century, she runs a florist shop - fulfilling her fake, mortal life. Until the breathtaking Parker Thomas hires her to decorate his grand estate for a gala. Five hundred roses? Easy enough. Except Parker makes her feel things she can&#39;t ignore...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the God of Fertility, Pan is used to maidens flocking in droves to his pastures. So when Syrinx denies him, he&#39;s determined to win the one that got away. He poses as a mortal to get close to her, but he doesn&#39;t count on falling hard for his conquest - hard enough to make a life and stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Syrinx is falling in love with a man that doesn&#39;t exist. Can Pan hide his identity forever, or will the truth tear them apart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
