  <title>Just My Luck - Kelley Vitollo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Betsy Harris has worked hard to make sure her life appears as normal as possible. With how shy she is, she&#39;s sure everyone in Shamrock Falls already knows there&#39;s something different about her, but she&#39;ll do anything to keep them from learning her secret. Especially Jace Macnamara, the guy she&#39;s been crushing on since she moved to town. Only, when Jace makes Betsy an offer that will solve her money problems, she finds herself a whole lot closer to the gorgeous lawyer than she ever expected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace just found out he needs a wife ASAP. His childhood home--the last reminder he has of his deceased parents--can only become his if he marries, but Jace, ever the playboy, never dreamed of settling down for real. Neither Betsy nor Jace wants to ruin their friendship when their fake marriage inevitably ends, so they vow to keep things light, professional, easy. But as Betsy comes out of her shell, Jace begins to see his &quot;wife&quot; for the beautiful, caring woman she is. Suddenly, there&#39;s a lot more at risk than just his inheritance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shamrock Falls series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Lucky Break&lt;br&gt;* Luck of the Draw&lt;br&gt;* Just My Luck&lt;/p&gt;" />
