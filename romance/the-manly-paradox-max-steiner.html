  <title>The Manly Paradox - Max Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Manley Paradox is the story of a romance between a young poor orphan and a rich girl whose father is not only arrogant and controlling but has something to hide.
&lt;p&gt;
The boy, Chris, is a student in computer science but is so poor that he is actually homeless until one of his professors finds him sleeping in the woods. As an undergrad Chris becomes interested in the security of financial transfers. As part of his research he stumbles across the very rich Manly family that controls a financial transfer company. 
&lt;p&gt;
When Kyle Manly turns up at the same university, Chris is a first year grad student and she is in a freshman in a section that he teaches. He dislikes the Manly family based on what he knows about them but finds himself attracted to Kyle. Kyle for her part is infatuated with Chris and has no idea how to proceed.
&lt;p&gt;
Kyles father has given a grant to the university and Chris works on the grant. As part of his work he is asked to see if the companys security can be breached and whether he can take money without getting caught. This turns out to be a setup. Chris is eventually arrested and charged with theft. 
&lt;p&gt;
One must believe that in all young romance, love and truth should triumph.&lt;br&gt;" />
