  <title>On Sexuality and Scripture - Jim Naughton, Masiiwa Ragies Gunda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Of interest to biblical scholars, students, and those following the international
debate on same-sex issues
• Internationally-known authors
• Demonstrates serious students of Scripture can find good news for LGBTQ people
and churches that affirm them in the Bible and the life and teachings of Jesus
The Chicago Consultation has sponsored consultations in South Africa, Kenya,
and Ghana on Scripture and sexuality. With papers, Bible studies, and personal
essays from American, African, and other international scholars, this book offers
a new way of approaching sacred texts to discover what the Bible does and does
not say about human sexuality.
The Chicago Consultation has developed a reputation for civil conversation among
those on multiple sides of issues related to gender equality. Their work in Africa
builds on that reputation, now reaching international biblical scholars and students." />
