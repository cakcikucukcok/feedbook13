  <title>Novena Meditations With Pope John Paul II - David Werthmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Noah, his wife, and family obediently respond to God in the face of a world that has turned away from its Creator. The &lt;I&gt;Heroic Lives of Faith&lt;/I&gt; series looks at many major figures of the Bible -- both men and women. Biographical sketches and spiritual reflection unite to help readers understand that these heroic people faced many of the same problems we do, and have triumphed over many of the same adversaries. Although we see them stumble and fall, we also see them steadfast in their faith. Each pamphlet includes reflection questions, a closing prayer, and a conclusion that help relate the message and lesson of the pamphlet to daily life. &lt;I&gt;Heroic Lives of Faith&lt;/I&gt; pamphlets are a valuable education and formation tool, and are intended for either individual or group use." />
