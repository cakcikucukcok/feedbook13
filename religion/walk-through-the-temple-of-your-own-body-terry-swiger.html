  <title>Walk Through the Temple of Your Own Body - Terry Swiger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the upmost intimacy, the Spirit of the Lord unveiled many hidden secrets of Gods image throughout our bones.   It was because of this Teachers insight and guidance through the study of the musculoskeletal system, I was privileged to enjoy this eye-opening journey.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;While on our path of study, this amazing Teacher highlighted descriptive words along with biblical number values that were as golden nuggets or stepping stones through the temple of my own body. Those same golden nuggets proved to reveal hidden secrets of Gods handiwork as from a carpenters blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit of the Lord revealed Gods image in one group of our bones, to represent Jesus birth; His life and ministry; thorns that relate to the Kingdom of God, and the fruits of the Holy Spirit.  Revelation 4:2-4 has a powerful image of God that surrounds the Sword of the Spirit; and a breathtaking image of Gods love through the Cross.   Each and every one of Gods images relate to Genesis 1:26.  God said, Let Us make man in our image, according to Our likeness  I was constantly reminded that these images of God, and more, were first framed within Adams bones, and they exceed far above all the animals that God Created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book holds a gift of love and encouragement for the entire body of Christ as well as those who are searching for unshakeable identity.  Gods image, cleverly designed within our bones will build greater confidence to allow Gods power to flow more freely.&lt;/p&gt;" />
