  <title>Red&amp;#39;s Planet (Book 1) - Eddie Pittman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;Red&#39;s Planet&lt;/I&gt;, an intergalactic graphic novel fantasy series from award-winning cartoonist Eddie Pittman (writer/story artist for Disney&#39;s hit TV series &lt;I&gt;Phineas and Ferb&lt;/I&gt;), is a nonstop adventure with a unique cast of characters unlike any you&#39;ve ever seen before.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; Meet Red, a quirky, headstrong 10-year-old who longs to live in her own perfect paradise far away from her annoying foster family. But when a UFO mistakenly kidnaps her, Red finds herself farther away than she could have possibly imagined--across the galaxy and aboard an enormous spaceship owned by the Aquilari, an ancient creature with a taste for rare and unusual treasures. Before Red can be discovered as a stowaway, the great ship crashes on a small deserted planet, leaving her marooned with a menagerie of misfit aliens. With her newfound friend, a small gray alien named Tawee, Red must find a way to survive the hostile castaways, evade the ravenous wildlife, and contend with Goose, the planet&#39;s grumpy, felinoid custodian. Surely this can&#39;t be the paradise she&#39;s been hoping for.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; Fans of Mike Maihack&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Cleopatra in Space&lt;/I&gt; and Ben Hatke&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Zita the Spacegirl&lt;/I&gt; will embrace &lt;I&gt;Red&#39;s Planet&lt;/I&gt;, a boldly illustrated and imaginative new series for readers of all ages.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &quot;Fun, sharp, hilarious, and rip-roaringly original!&quot;&quot;-- Jeff Smith, &lt;I&gt;Bone &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &quot;The only thing that&#39;s missing is seeing &lt;I&gt;Red&#39;s Planet &lt;/I&gt;on my bookshelf-- sandwiched between Jeff Smith&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Bone&lt;/I&gt; and my library of Pixar Films.&quot;-- Mike Maihack, &lt;I&gt;Cleopatra in Space &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &quot;Red&#39;s Planet is a fantastic and fun journey for young readers, but it&#39;s also a great trip down memory lane for their parents. The story weaves together a lot of the fun stories we watched  and read in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s and spins them into something new.&quot; -- Kazu Kibuishi, creator of Amulet, Flight, and Explorer&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &quot;Filled with genuine sense of childlike awe and style of story, art, and filmmaking reminiscent of Jeff Smith&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Bone&lt;/I&gt;. Eddie Pittman really has the goods.&quot; -- Dan Povenmire, co-creator of Disney&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Phineas and Ferb &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &quot;A meeting of everything that is great about comic books...incredible art, spellbinding storytelling, rich characters, fun, adventure, humor...and heart.&quot; -- Tom Richmond, &lt;I&gt;Mad&lt;/I&gt; Magazine artist and President of the National Cartoonist Society &lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
