  <title>Out of Control (A Babysitting a Billionaire Novel) - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Out of Control (A Babysitting a Billionaire Novel) by Nina Croft&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s a challenge he can&#39;t resist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollywood heartthrob Zachary Hunter loves women--as long as they don&#39;t want more than a little fun in the bedroom. When his most recent movie stirs up the wrong kind of attention, the kind that includes an attempt on his life, he hires a friend&#39;s company to locate the threat. The pint-sized redhead assigned to protect him isn&#39;t what he expects--or wants. Worse, he can&#39;t take his eyes off of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ten years in the army, Danielle Sinclair knows how to handle men. With a new security gig to pass the time until she&#39;s cleared to return to the military, she&#39;s figures her sexy new client will be easy to manage. And then he opens his gorgeous mouth, and she can&#39;t decide whether to kiss him or kill him. His sex appeal may tempt her into his bed, but his sexist attitude is unbearable, and she&#39;s going to make him eat every single word...&lt;/p&gt;" />
