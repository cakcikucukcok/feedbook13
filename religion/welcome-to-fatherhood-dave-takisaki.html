  <title>Welcome to Fatherhood. - Dave Takisaki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fatherhood is a lifelong journey that twists and turns, has its ups and downs, like a long country road. Nothing quite prepares you for the start of the fatherhood journey, there is no map. However, we can learn from other who have traveled down that same unpredictable road. The book “Welcome to Fatherhood. Real Talk.” is an introduction to fatherhood for new dads who are in the whirlwind of fatherhood. The author taps into his past as a new father and unearths the valuable lessons every new dad should know. The book is designed to be real and raw; including funny stories from the author and invaluable scripture from the Bible. Excerpt“Having children is a very sanctifying and humbling process and there will be many laughs, tears, and hair pulling moments throughout the years. But that is how memories are made, through the ups and downs in life. We wouldn’t savor the sweet times of gathering around a campfire roasting mallows with your kids without the trying times of raising them up from newborns. Just like a sports team and the process they have to undergo, they can’t just step on to a field against another great team and expect to win. They must go through the blood, sweat and tears of practice and have the patience and belief that the process will work.”Fathers have a major responsibility in life, just as Proverbs 22:6 says, “Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it” (ESV). Not only are we called to husbands and dads, we are also called to be ministers to our children and speaking truth into their life. The book “Welcome to Fatherhood. Real Talk.” will walk through the many different hats a father must wear and the many different plates he must keep spinning. This book will also give new fathers a few practical concepts, or “life hacks”, to help make life just a little bit easier" />
