  <title>The Last Natural - Rob Miech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before Bryce Harper was the top pick in the Major League Baseball draft, before he signed the sport&#39;s biggest contract ever for a first-year pro, he gambled his future on one make-or-break season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas High School sophomore already had dominated the competition like Mickey Mantle on the playground and appeared on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;, which dubbed him the &quot;most exciting prodigy since LeBron James.&quot; Seeking greater tests as a hitter, the precocious phenom got his GED and enrolled at the College of Southern Nevada, where he could face pro prospects in a challenging wooden-bat league that prohibited the hitter-friendly aluminum bats used throughout college ball. Harper shattered the school&#39;s home run record with 31 (the previous mark was 12) and compiled a startling 1.513 OPS while leading his team to the Junior College World Series. For his heroics, the 17-year-old became the only position player from a junior college to win the Golden Spikes Award, given to the nation&#39;s best amateur baseball player. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas sportswriter Rob Miech was &quot;embedded&quot; with the Southern Nevada Coyotes team and brings us along for the ride--into the dugout and locker room and on team buses and in motel rooms, from the scorched fields to the snow-capped horizons of the Scenic West Athletic Conference--to deliver a warts-and-all account of a boy among men playing like a man among boys. Amid the media circus that descended upon team and town, we read fascinating personal stories including the dynamics between veteran coach Tim Chambers and Harper&#39;s protective father, the camaraderie with--and jealousies of--other players, the fans and autograph seekers (and girls) who all want a piece of the young star, and how Harper is suspended from the World Series after protesting an umpire&#39;s call, and the role his faith plays in his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last Natural&lt;/i&gt; shows us a season in the life of baseball&#39;s top rising star, culminating in a dramatic conclusion when Harper is drafted #1 by the Washington Nationals and, after tense negotiations that go up until just seconds before the midnight deadline, signs a $9.9 million contract. Even more than this, Miech&#39;s book is the story of a team and its community, the hopes and aspirations of its players and coaches, and the spirit of pure baseball that lies at the heart of the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
