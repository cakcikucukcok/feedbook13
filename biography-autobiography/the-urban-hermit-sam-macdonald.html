  <title>The Urban Hermit - Sam Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faced with the truth that his debts and his waistline had both ballooned out of control, Sam MacDonald devised a plan to change his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sam graduated from Yale in 1995, he watched a classmate make inroads as a head-office guy in professional baseball, another become a day-trading millionaire, and another develop connections at the Playboy Mansion. Struggling to make ends meet, he shrugged his shoulders at their success and raised a tall one to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until April 2000 that Sam got his wake-up call. He weighed 340 lbs. He was flat broke. And the IRS had caught up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a desperate attempt to save himself, Sam decided to limit himself to a budget of $8 a week and 800 calories a day. He called it &quot;The Urban Hermit Plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He thought he would do it for a month. Instead, he embarked on a bizarre year-long journey. He lost 160 pounds in the process, befriended rent-dodging trailer-park denizens, flew to Bosnia on assignment, traveled to a peace festival in a hippie van, had a run-in with Cooter from the Dukes of Hazzard, and met the woman who would later become his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Urban Hermit is a wildly hilarious story about backwoods living, as told by a man who should have known better.&lt;/p&gt;" />
