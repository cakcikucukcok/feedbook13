  <title>Never Shoot a Stampede Queen - Mark Leiren-Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Winner of the 2009 Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;The cops wanted to shoot me, my bosses thought I was a Bolshevik, and a local lawyer warned me that some people I was writing about might try to test the strength of my skull with a steel pipe. What more could any young reporter hope for from his first real job? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night Mark Leiren-Young drove into Williams Lake, British Columbia, in 1985 to work as a reporter for the venerable &lt;i&gt;Williams Lake Tribune&lt;/i&gt;, he arrived on the scene of an armed robbery. And that was before things got weird. For a 22-year-old from Vancouver, a stint in the legendary Cariboo town was a trip to another world and another era. From the explosive opening, where Mark finds himself in a courtroom just a few feet away from a defendant with a bomb strapped to his chest, to the case of a plane that crashed without its pilot on board, &lt;i&gt;Never Shoot a Stampede Queen&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable comic memoir of a city boy learning about—and learning to love—life in a cowboy town. &lt;/p&gt;" />
