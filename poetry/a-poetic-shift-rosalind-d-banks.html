  <title>A Poetic Shift - Rosalind D. Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She went from mixed up and messed up to fixed up and blessed up.
This story consists of several events that have taken place in the life of a young woman in her relatively short life. It contains life-threatening situations as she struggles to provide a family unit for her four children as well as herself. Her dream was to grow up and become a successful black woman with a husband and a family. The story begins with her life as a young girl growing up in a poor family. The mother was disabled, and the stepfather struggled with alcoholism. 
Her experiences are inspiring as well as heart chilling. She has experienced many hardships that many women wont experience in a lifetime. She has had a series of events take place that would have shattered the average persons life forever. Some of these incidents include a series of broken marriages, thirteen proposals, cancer, her four-month-old sons death, surviving being struck down by a car, Crohns disease, living in a battered womens shelter after suffering physical and verbal abuse, being a teenage runaway, being homeless, losing everything she ever owned, and many other trials and hardships. She says her experiences have made her stronger and have touched the lives of others who have been a part of her life. She says that she knows that God has protected her through her trials and tribulations. 
As you share with her through the corridors of her past, she prays that your hearts will be touched and your minds renewed. Each and every one that has been a part of her life certainly knows that there is a God somewhere. She is now going on to share her poetry through books, plays, songs, and recitals. Her message to all women is to press on in spite of the situation or circumstance. God can do anything but fail. The main goal of this story is to prove that in spite of where you come from or your educational background, with a made up mind and a sincere heart, your life can go from mixed up and messed up to fixed up and blessed up! Surely, God is able!" />
