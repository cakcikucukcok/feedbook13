  <title>How to Win at High School - Owen Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adam Higgs is a loser, and he&amp;#39;s not okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But starting as a junior in a new high school seems like exactly the right time to change things. He brainstorms with his best friend, Brian: What will it take for him to &lt;em&gt;take over&lt;/em&gt; Nixon Collegiate? Adam searches for the A-listers&amp;#39; weak spot and strikes gold when he gets queen bee Sara Bryant to pay him for doing her physics homework. One part nerd, two parts badass, Adam ditches his legit job and turns to full-time cheating. His clients? All the Nixon Collegiate gods and goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon his homework business becomes a booze business, which becomes a fake ID business. Adam&amp;#39;s popularity soars as he unlocks high school achievements left and right, from his first kiss to his first rebound hookup. But something else is haunting him&amp;#8212;a dark memory from his past, driving him to keep climbing. What is it? And will he go too far?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win at High School&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s honest picture of high school hierarchy combines with an over-the-top, adrenaline-charged story line, and Adam&amp;#39;s rocket ride to the top of the social order (and his subsequent flameout) is by turns bawdy and sweetly emotional.&lt;/p&gt;" />
