  <title>Breath of Life - Daniel B. McVey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/i&gt;tells the story of a volunteer ?re?ghters life as an EMT and a ?re?ghter. Author Daniel McVey chronicles the harrowing stories of saving lives and facing death on a daily basis; he also shares stories of the dedication and professionalism of his comrades. He describes the small village on Long Island called Floral Park, where he belonged to the Rescue Company of the Floral Park Fire Department. While they were primarily responsible for medical emergencies; the stories included in &lt;i&gt;Breath of Life&lt;/i&gt; provide an intimate view of the dangers these heroes faced as volunteers who also had full-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Floral Park, McVey set his sights on becoming a volunteer ?re?ghter after taking a CPR course taught by three members of the Rescue Company. From that point on, his stories give a realistic picture of the stresses of emergency care for life-threatening emergencies. Covering the period from the mid to late 1980s into the 1990s, McVey chronicles how the morale of the Rescue Company had many ups and downs and how several members brought the company back together again. In July of 1999, he responded to his last call, thus ending an exciting time as a volunteer ?re?ghter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
