      <meta name="description" content="Each time I saw Noona, there was some new twist to learn. These eventually became so numerous and ironclad that I called them Noonas Rules. 
Rule # 4: All men are liars. I dont believe anything they say. In her entire life, Noona had only experienced negative relationships with men. She did not know when someone was being nice, so she interpreted acts of kindness suspiciously as potential exploitation or lies. It gave me an idea about what her life was like, but when you think about it, a whore in Thailand probably hears more lies and promises than anyone in the world. 
Rule #5: You cannot know the future, so dont worry about it. You cannot undo the past, so dont talk about what happened. This rule was a mix of Thai Buddhism and Noonas nihilism, but it was a simple way of keeping a focus on the present and avoiding feelings of regret or hope." />
