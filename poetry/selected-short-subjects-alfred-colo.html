  <title>Selected Short Subjects - Alfred Colo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Octogenarian, author-Alfred Colo, celebrated his eighty sixth birthday in December of 2012, with the completion of this, his eleventh self-published work with Xlibris Publishing Co., expected to become available in early 2013.
His early origins as a singer-song writer, have come full circle from modest, creative love lyrics, to full-blown, mature poetry-writings, with a passion for words extending well beyond the mere expressions of love. With an ever growing appetite, Colo knew that the time to go public was now or never, and worthy enough to share before the flame of his torch was extinguished.
Alfred took up permanent residence in the growing, smallish town of New Fairfield, CT., after a set of compelling circumstances led him to exit the Big Apple, where he spent the greater part of his formative years, to taking on a new role as companion-caregiver to a long-standing friend, victim of a stroke.
The author currently pursues active completion of his prolific outpourings on a wide range of subjects, outlined in (Other books by the author) - found on the rear cover of this book. While still going like sixty at a white-heat-rate, he may put other writers, half his age, to shame.
His yet unpublished collections, grown over years of maturation and perfecting, are only now expected to be laced in book form, wrapped in ribbons, and garnished with final trappings of publications bows. Colos quest to finalize as much of his lifes legacy as possible, has, he states, kept him alive, longer than any expectation he allowed himself even to conjure. Late fame, alas, may arrive postumously, though most assuredly without the fortunes of success in this world! You cant take with you what cant be spent beyond the grave. Far greater, however, are the riches, other than noteriety and fame, he expects will endure through generations of time to come." />
