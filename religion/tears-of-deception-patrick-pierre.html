  <title>Tears of Deception - Patrick Pierre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tears of Deception is based on a true story. It demonstrates the power
of forgiveness and the power of love over vengeance and hate. It is a love
story which contains a religious awakening that would allow one to see
the mercy of God.
Pachouco in his love life deceptions quickly recognized the power of
prayers because his mother, Faye Esther was a praying woman. Pachouco
understood that God can and will pardon anyone who confesses and
repents of his or her sins. He also understood Gods capability of looking
beyond the sinner mans fault and sees his needs. Again, this is the power
of love, confession and forgiveness. Through it all, Pachouco learned a
valuable lesson,  never said never because God is in control.
Written by Patrick Pierre, Senior Pastor of Union Baptist Church United
Ministry, in Society Hill, South Carolina.
To God be the glory." />
