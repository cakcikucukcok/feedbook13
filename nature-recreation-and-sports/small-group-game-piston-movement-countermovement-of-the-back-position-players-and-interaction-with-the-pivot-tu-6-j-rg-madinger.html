  <title>Small group game: Piston movement/countermovement of the back position players and interaction with the pivot (TU 6) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This training unit focuses on the interaction of the back position players with each other regarding piston movement/countermovement and passing to the pivot. Following warm-up, the back position players take the first methodical step regarding the interaction with the pivot during the ball familiarization phase. During the goalkeeper warm-up shooting and a subsequent offense exercise, the players practice the piston movement/countermovement which should result in a shot. In the following two small group exercises, the players stepwise further develop their piston movement/countermovement and the interaction with the pivot. The final exercise combines the different elements that the players practiced before with an initial action and creative continuous playing.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Warm-up/Stretching (10/20)
- Ball familiarization (10/30)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/40)
- Offense/Individual (10/50)
- Offense/Small groups (15/65)
- Offense/Small groups (15/80)
- Offense/Team (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Difficulty: High level (youth teams from 15 years of age and older)" />
