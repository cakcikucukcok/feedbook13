  <title>Vincent de Paul, the Lazarist Mission, and French Catholic Reform - Alison Forrestal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vincent de Paul, the Lazarist Mission, and French Catholic Reform offers a major re-assessment of the thought and activities of the most famous figure of the seventeenth-century French Catholic Reformation, Vincent de Paul.  Confronting traditional explanations for de Paul&#39;s prominence in the dévot reform movement that emerged in the wake of the Wars of Religion, the volume explores how he turned a personal vocational desire to evangelize the
rural poor of France into a congregation of secular missionaries, known as the Congregation of the Mission or the Lazarists, with three inter-related strands of pastoral responsibility:  the delivery of missions, the formation and training of clergy, and the promotion of confraternal welfare.
Alison Forrestal further demonstrates that the structure, ethos, and works that de Paul devised for the Congregation placed it at the heart of a significant enterprise of reform that involved a broad set of associates in efforts to transform the character of devotional belief and practice within the church. The central questions of the volume therefore concern de Paul&#39;s efforts to create, characterize, and articulate a distinctive and influential vision for missionary life and work, both for
himself and for the Lazarist Congregation, and Forrestal argues that his prominence and achievements depended on his remarkable ability to exploit the potential for association and collaboration within the dévot environment of seventeenth-century France in enterprising and systematic ways.
This is the first study to assess de Paul&#39;s activities against the wider backdrop of religious reform and Bourbon rule, and to reconstruct the combination of ideas, practices, resources, and relationships that determined his ability to pursue his ambitions.  A work of forensic detail and complex narrative, Vincent de Paul, the Lazarist Mission, and French Catholic Reform is the product of years of research in ecclesiastical and state archives.  It offers a wholly fresh perspective on
the challenges and opportunities entailed in the promotion of religious reform and renewal in seventeenth-century France." />
