  <title>Algebra for the Urban Student - Canaa Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Algebra for the Urban Student&lt;/i&gt; offers an algebra textbook for the typical math student. In many cases, such textbooks are written for people who love mathematics and understand the jargon. Teacher Canaa Lee has incorporated her personal experiences as a high school mathematics teacher into a textbook that is specially geared toward students needs. Most students dislike mathematics because the subject has always been difficult for them to master. With this in mind, &lt;i&gt;Algebra for the Urban Student&lt;/i&gt; builds on methods Lee has used successfully in her classroom to motivate her students to a better more practical understanding of math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When students need to learn math concepts, they can turn to a clearly written, easy-to-use guide to help them complete their assignments. Each chapter in &lt;i&gt;Algebra for the Urban Student&lt;/i&gt; illustrates a significant algebra concept, such as solving linear equations and inequalities or finding the slope of a line. The chapters also include homework assignments that provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the concept explained in that chapter. In addition, there are real-world projects for both algebra and geometry and guides for whole and small class discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Algebra for the Urban Student&lt;/i&gt; insures that every student has the information they need to succeed at mathematics. &lt;/p&gt;" />
