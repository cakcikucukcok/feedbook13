  <title>Gathered for God - Jeffrey Lee, Dent Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• The next generation of the classic Episcopal teaching series
• Accessible and engaging enough for newcomers and adult learners, but full of
content for church leaders and seminarians
• Filled with interactive study questions and accompanied by online materials
The new Church’s Teachings series has been one of the most recognizable and useful sets of books in the Episcopal Church. With the launch of the Church’s Teachings for a Changing World series, visionary Episcopal thinkers and leaders have teamed up to write a new set of books, grounded and thoughtful enough for seminarians and leaders, concise and accessible enough for newcomers, with a host of discussion resources that help readers to dig deep.
What’s really going on when Episcopalians gather for worship? Musician Dent Davidson and Bishop Jeff Lee bring decades of partnership to this lively conversation about the rituals that make faith real—gathering, bathing, welcoming, storytelling, feasting, and sending God’s people. More than a treatise on the Book
of Common Prayer, Gathered for God opens fresh ways of seeing what the Prayer Book makes possible." />
