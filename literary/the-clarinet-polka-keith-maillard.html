  <title>The Clarinet Polka - Keith Maillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Keith Maillard received critical acclaim with his novel &lt;i&gt;Gloria&lt;/i&gt;, which told the story of a young woman on the cusp of womanhood in a town called Raysburg, West Virginia. In this book, &lt;i&gt;The Clarinet Polka&lt;/i&gt;, Maillard turns that same eagle-eyed attention to the other side of the tracks of that very same town and creates a stunning portrait of Polish America and of one man&#39;s struggle to find meaning in his life and roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 1969, and young Jimmy Koprowski returns from his stint in the airforce to Raysburg, his blue-collar Polish American hometown where nothing much happens beyond working at the steel mill, going to Mass, and getting drunk at the local PAC. Jimmy&#39;s efforts at rebuilding his life result in sleeping off hangovers in his parents&#39; attic and drifting into a destructive affair with a married woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things change when his younger sister Linda decides to start an all-girl polka band, and Jimmy falls for the band&#39;s star clarinetist, Janice, whose young life is haunted by tragic events that happened before she was born. The threads of Jimmy&#39;s family life, the legacy of WWII Poland, and the healing power of music, language, and tradition all begin to converge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once gritty and compassionate, moving and witty, &lt;i&gt;The Clarinet Polka&lt;/i&gt; showcases the emotional and perfectly pitched voice of a lost soul finding his way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
