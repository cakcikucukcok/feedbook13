  <title>Write Your Novel in a Month: How to Complete a First Draft in 30 Days and What to Do Next - Jeff Gerke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;One of these days, I&#39;m going to sit down and write that novel....&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone thinks about doing it, yet most people who do start a novel end up stalling after a few chapters. Where do these would-be novelists go wrong? Are the characters dull and cliched? Did the story arc collapse? Did they succumb to a dreaded bout of &quot;writer&#39;s block&quot;? Or maybe it was all just taking too long?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These problems used to stop writers in their tracks, but nothing will get in your way after reading &lt;i&gt;Write Your Novel in a Month&lt;/i&gt;. Author and instructor Jeff Gerke has created the perfect tool to show you how to prepare yourself to write your first draft in as little as 30 days. With Jeff&#39;s help, you will learn how to organize your ideas, create dynamic stories, develop believable characters, and flesh out the idea narrative for your novel--and not just for the rapid-fire first draft. Jeff walks you through the entire process, from initial idea to the important revision stage, and even explains what to do with your novel once you&#39;ve finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are participating in National Novel Writing Month or you&#39;re simply hoping to complete a draft over winter break or your vacation, this book covers the entire scope of writing a novel and lays out exactly what you need to know to get it done fast and right.&lt;/p&gt;" />
