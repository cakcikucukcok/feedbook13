  <title>Cut Both Ways - Carrie Mesrobian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A TOP 10 RAINBOW LIST BOOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William C. Morris YA Debut Award nominee Carrie Mesrobian delivers a &amp;#8220;raw, sympathetic coming-of-age story [that] uncovers the messy, painful, yet vitally important process of self-discovery&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;, starred review) when a high school senior comes to terms with his attraction to both his girlfriend and his male best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Will Caynes seventeen years to have his first kiss. He should be ecstatic&amp;#8230;except that it was with his best friend, Angus, while they were both drunk and stoned. Will&amp;#8217;s not gay, but he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; sort of enjoy whatever it was he felt with Angus. Unsettled by his growing interest in Angus, Will avoids his friend and even starts dating a sophomore, Brandy. When he&amp;#8217;s hooking up with her, he&amp;#8217;s totally into it, so he must be straight, right? Then why does he secretly keep going back to Angus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusing as Will&amp;#8217;s feelings are, they&amp;#8217;re a welcome distraction from his complicated home life. His father has started drinking earlier each day when he &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be working on never-ending house renovations. And his mom&amp;#8212;divorced and living in a McMansion with her new husband&amp;#8212;isn&amp;#8217;t much help, unless she&amp;#8217;s buying Will a bunch of stuff he doesn&amp;#8217;t need. Between the two of them, neither feels like much of a parent&amp;#8212;which leaves Will on his own in figuring things out with his girlfriend and best friend. He loves them both, but deciding who to be with will ultimately hurt someone. Himself, probably the most. &lt;/p&gt;" />
