  <title>The Terrorist Next Door - Daniel Levitas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;September 11, 2001, focused America&#39;s attention on the terrorist threat from abroad, but as the World Trade Center towers collapsed, domestic right-wing hate groups were celebrating in the United States.  &quot;Hallelu-Yahweh! May the WAR be started! DEATH to His enemies, may the World Trade Center BURN TO THE GROUND!&quot; announced August Kreis of the paramilitary group, the Posse Comitatus.  &quot;We can blame no others than ourselves for our problems due to the fact that we allow ...Satan&#39;s children, called jews (sic) today, to have dominion over our lives.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Terrorist Next Door&lt;/i&gt; reveals the men behind far right groups like the Posse Comitatus - Latin for &quot;power of the county&quot; -- and the ideas that inspired their attempts to bring about a racist revolution in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy McVeigh was executed for killing 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995, but The Terrorist Next Door goes well beyond the destruction in Oklahoma City and takes readers deeper and more broadly inside the Posse and other groups that comprise the paramilitary right. From the emergence of white supremacist groups following the Civil War, through the segregationist violence of the civil rights era, the right-wing tax protest movement of the 1970s, the farm crisis of the 1980s and the militia movement of the 1990s, the book details the roots of the radical right.  It also tells the story of men like William Potter Gale, a retired Army officer and the founder of the Posse Comitatus whose hate-filled sermons and calls to armed insurrection have fueled generations of tax protesters, militiamen and other anti-government zealots since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Daniel Levitas, a national expert on the origins and activities of white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, &lt;i&gt;The Terrorist Next Door&lt;/i&gt; is painstakingly researched and includes rich detail from official documents (including the FBI), private archives and confidential sources never before disclosed. In detailing these and other developments, &lt;i&gt;The Terrorist Next Door &lt;/i&gt;will prove to be the most definitive history of the roots of the American militia movement and the rural radical right ever written.&lt;/p&gt;" />
