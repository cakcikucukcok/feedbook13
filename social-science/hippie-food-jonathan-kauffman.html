  <title>Hippie Food - Jonathan Kauffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 James Beard Award Nominee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enlightening narrative history&amp;#8212;an entertaining fusion of Tom Wolfe and Michael Pollan&amp;#8212;that traces the colorful origins of once unconventional foods and the diverse fringe movements, charismatic gurus, and counterculture elements that brought them to the mainstream and created a distinctly American cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food writer Jonathan Kauffman journeys back more than half a century&amp;#8212;to the 1960s and 1970s&amp;#8212;to tell the story of how a coterie of unusual men and women embraced an alternative lifestyle that would ultimately change how modern Americans eat. Impeccably researched, &lt;em&gt;Hippie Food&lt;/em&gt; chronicles how the longhairs, revolutionaries, and back-to-the-landers rejected the square establishment of President Richard Nixon&amp;#8217;s America and turned to a more idealistic and wholesome communal way of life and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the mystical rock-and-roll cult known as the Source Family and its legendary vegetarian restaurant in Hollywood to the Diggers&amp;#8217; brown bread in the Summer of Love to the rise of the co-op and the origins of the organic food craze, Kauffman reveals how today&amp;#8217;s quotidian whole-foods staples&amp;#8212;including sprouts, tofu, yogurt, brown rice, and whole-grain bread&amp;#8212;were introduced and eventually became part of our diets. From coast to coast, through Oregon, Texas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Vermont, Kauffman tracks hippie food&amp;#8217;s journey from niche oddity to a cuisine that hit every corner of this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slick mix of gonzo playfulness, evocative detail, skillful pacing, and elegant writing, &lt;em&gt;Hippie Food&lt;/em&gt; is a lively, engaging, and informative read that deepens our understanding of our culture and our lives today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
