  <title>A Patient’S Guide to Psychotherapy - Donald B. Colson, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How therapy works often remains shrouded in mystery for prospective patients and therapists in training, which does nothing to help either party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald B. Colson, who spent his career as a therapist and psychoanalyst, makes the process user friendly with this overview of what you can expect from therapy. Taking a no-nonsense approach, he explores how to tackle problems head on and work with a therapist to solve them. Beginning students of psychotherapy, graduate students, and therapists in training will also find the text instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colson reviews the reasons someone might seek therapy as well as how to find a therapist that meets your needs. He also explains how therapy works and highlights key concepts such as the centrality of relationships, attachment, unconscious processes, defenses, transference, and counter-transference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll also learn the main reasons patients seek relief, how therapists facilitate change, and the uses and misuses of diagnosis and diagnostic labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking help from a therapist does not show weakness; it takes much more courage to confront personal problems than it takes to avoid them. Start overcoming fear, anger, shame, guilt, and troubled relationships with A Patients Guide to Psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
