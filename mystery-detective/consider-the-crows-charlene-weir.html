  <title>Consider the Crows - Charlene Weir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A phone call announcing murder rudely interrupts a quiet Sunday morning for chief of police Susan Wren.  The body of Lynelle Hames, a quiet young woman newly arrived in Hampstead, Kansas, has been found near the isolated old house where she was living.  Susan herself is a recent arrival in the small town.  A former San Francisco cop, she chose to stay on as chief after solving the murder of her new husband one year before (&lt;i&gt;The Winter Widow&lt;/i&gt;, SMP, 1992).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cold determination, Susan begins her investigation, but matters are soon complicated by the disappearance of a prominent citizen.  As the vice-chancellor of Emerson College, Hilary Kalazar knew Lynnelle, who worked as a clerk-typist at the local school.  Is Hilary&#39;s failure to arrive at the Dallas convention where she was scheduled to speak a coincidence, or is it somehow connected to Lynnelle&#39;s murder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town begins to panic, with the mayor dogging Susan&#39;s every step and the townspeople arming themselves against a faceless danger.  Hampered by treacherous weather, tangled lies, and small-town secrets, Susan investigates with street-smart persistence, knowing that unless she moves fast, the killer will strike again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both poignant and wry, &lt;i&gt;Consider the Crows&lt;/i&gt; is also a thoroughly entertaining puzzler of a mystery novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
