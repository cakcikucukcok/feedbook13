  <title>The Red Man&#39;s Continent - Ellsworth Huntington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States, except Hawaii and territories of the United States. More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term &amp;quot;American Indian&amp;quot; excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives, while &amp;quot;Native Americans&amp;quot; (as defined by the US Census) are American Indians, plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities. The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro, instead being included in the Census grouping of &amp;quot;Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ellsworth Huntington (September 16, 1876 &amp;ndash; October 17, 1947) was a professor of geography at Yale University during the early 20th century, known for his studies on environmental determinism/climatic determinism, economic growth and economic geography. He served as President of the Ecological Society of America in 1917, the Association of American Geographers in 1923 and President of the Board of Directors of the Society for Biodemography and Social Biology from 1934 to 1938." />
