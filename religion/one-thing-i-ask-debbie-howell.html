This is a great book on the joys and burdens of living a prayer filled life. Debbie relates experiences with Chris, her husband, and her two daughters, Jasmine and Camilia. She is not afraid to tell of disappointment as well as success. It will inspire each reader to a deeper experience with Jesus Christ.
Pr. David Newman
One Thing I Ask will inspire you to open your heart to the faithfulness of God. As I began to read, each chapter spoke to me about who God is and it reminded me of who I am in Him. This book encourages you to find scripture that will help support you on your journey with God, enabling you to connect with Him on a deeper level. Thank you, Debbie for being vulnerable enough to share moments where God has impacted your life greatly.
