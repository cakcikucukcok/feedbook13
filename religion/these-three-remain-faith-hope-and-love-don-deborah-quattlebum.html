  <title>These Three Remain: Faith, Hope, and Love - Don, Deborah Quattlebum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It may be an oversimplification to say that faith, hope, and love are all we need. But with an understanding of what these three are, we have a better understanding of what they can do in our lives.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus will turn from our needs and wants to what leads us into the answer of all these thingsfaith, hope, and love, which we find through our relationships with Jesus. It is simple but not always easy to allow the control of our life to transfer from us to God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know these three, what they are, and how we interact with them. We want to look at these three as the following: 
	Faith, the God-Possible
	Hope, the God-Perspective
	Love, the God-Power&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these three we make all things about Jesus and less about us. The more we live in these three, the more we become like Him. These three, faith, hope, and love, will do the work to establish the kingdom of God in us and in others.&lt;p&gt;" />
