  <title>Rebel Mechanics - Shanna Swendson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1888, and seventeen-year-old Verity Newton lands a job  in New York as a governess to a wealthy leading family--but she quickly learns that the family has big secrets. Magisters have always ruled the colonies, but now an underground society of mechanics and engineers are developing non-magical sources of power via steam engines that they hope will help them gain freedom from British rule. The family Verity works for is magister--but it seems like the children&#39;s young guardian uncle is sympathetic to the rebel cause. As Verity falls for a charming rebel inventor and agrees to become a spy, she also becomes more and more enmeshed in the magister family&#39;s life. She soon realizes she&#39;s uniquely positioned to advance the cause--but to do so, she&#39;ll have to reveal her own dangerous secret.&lt;/p&gt;" />
