  <title>How to Be Eaten by a Lion - Michael Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From the monk who sets himself on fire in a crowded intersection of Saigon (&amp;#147;the familiar corded tendons of his hands, become / a bracken of ashes, a carbon twine of burnt&amp;#8221;), to the salmon run in British Columbia (&amp;#147;The salmon word / for home is glacierdust and once-tall trees unlimbed, / a taste, no matter where, they know&amp;#8221;), Johnson writes of topics varied and eclectic, unified by a focus on moments both declining and revenant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Startling and haunting, the poems delve into the ways in which these moments are transformative, beautiful and unexpected. Being eaten by a lion is a gift rather than a loss, an opportunity for grace: &amp;#147;Instead, focus on your life, / its crimson liquor he grows drunk on. / Notice the way the red highlights his face, / how the snub nose is softened, the lips made / fuller; notice his deft musculature, his rapture.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lyrical and rich with visceral imagery, &lt;I&gt;How to Be Eaten by a Lion&lt;/I&gt; lingers, exploring the world with an eye for detail and an ear for music.&lt;/div&gt;" />
