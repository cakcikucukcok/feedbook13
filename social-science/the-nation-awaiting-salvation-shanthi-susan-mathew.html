  <title>The Nation Awaiting Salvation - Shanthi Susan Mathew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the failure of a nation that Marquez depicts through the story of Macondo, a place erased from the surface of earth. To analyze the cause of destruction of Macondo a comparative study is done between Macondo and Kingdom of God of Bible. This comparative study is done because Macondo is termed as New Eden and New Jerusalem by critics. It is referred to as New Eden or New Jerusalem because it provided shelter for the rejected people and gave them a chance for a new beginning and a new life. Still it turned out to be a failure as they continued primitive notions about life. The old law foils new law regarding life. So instead of becoming a place flowing with milk and honey it remained a place where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, a place of utter failure and chaos." />
