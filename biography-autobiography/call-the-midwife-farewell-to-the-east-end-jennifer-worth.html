  <title>Call the Midwife: Farewell to the East End - Jennifer Worth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last book in the trilogy begun by Jennifer Worth&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller and the basis for the PBS series &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When twenty-two-year-old Jennifer Worth, from a comfortable middle-class upbringing, went to work as a midwife in the poorest section of postwar London, she not only delivered hundreds of babies and touched many lives, she also became the neighborhood&amp;#39;s most vivid chronicler. &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife: Farewell to the East End&lt;/em&gt; is the last book in Worth&amp;#39;s memoir trilogy, which the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt; described as &amp;#34;powerful stories with sweet charm and controlled outrage&amp;#34; in the face of dire circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, at last, is the full story of Chummy&amp;#39;s delightful courtship and wedding. We also meet Megan&amp;#39;mave, identical twins who share a browbeaten husband, and return to Sister Monica Joan, who is in top eccentric form. As in Worth&amp;#39;s first two books, &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife: A Memoir of Birth, Joy, and Hard Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife: Shadows of the Workhouse&lt;/em&gt;, the vividly portrayed denizens of a postwar East End contend with the trials of extreme poverty&amp;#8212;unsanitary conditions, hunger, and disease&amp;#8212;and find surprising ways to thrive in their tightly knit community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rich portrait of a bygone era of comradeship and midwifery populated by unforgettable characters, &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife: Farewell to the East End&lt;/em&gt; will appeal to readers of Frank McCourt, Katherine Boo, and James Herriot, as well as to the fans of the acclaimed PBS show based on the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
