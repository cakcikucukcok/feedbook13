  <title>Rumi: The Book of Love - Coleman Barks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Sufi mystic and poet Jalaluddin Rumi is most beloved for his poems expressing the ecstasies and mysteries of love in all its forms&amp;#8212;erotic, platonic, divine&amp;#8212;and Coleman Barks presents the best of them in this delightful and inspiring collection. Rendered with freshness, intensity, and beauty as Barks alone can do, these startling and rich poems range from the &quot;wholeness&quot; one experiences with a true lover, to the grief of a lover&#39;s loss, and all the states in between: from the madness of sudden love to the shifting of a romance to deep friendship to the immersion in divine love. Rumi, the ultimate poet of love, explores all &quot;the magnificent regions of the heart,&quot; and he opens you to the lover within. Coleman Barks has made this medieval, Persian-born (present-day Afghanistan) poetic and spiritual genius the most popular poet in America today. This seductive volume reveals Rumi&#39;s charms and depths more than any other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
