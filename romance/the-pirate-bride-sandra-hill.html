  <title>The Pirate Bride - Sandra Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Viking to bed, not to wed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medana Elsadottir, known as the Sea Scourge, never planned to become a pirate, but there&amp;#8217;s no denying her talent. Her female-only tribe has an island hideaway, food aplenty, goods to trade&amp;#8230;everything except the means to breed. That&amp;#8217;s where the strapping Norsemen tied up in her ship&amp;#8217;s hold come in handy. Eight godly specimens&amp;#8212;and Thork Tykirrson is the most virile of them all. Once their, eh, work is done, they&amp;#8217;ll be free to leave. Medana had naught to due with this gods-awful plan, but she wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wed or bed&amp;#8230;this Viking has plans of his own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renowned as the wildest Viking of his time, Thork was returning home to regain his father&amp;#8217;s favor. Mayhap even (&lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;) marry. His brazen&amp;#8212;and very beautiful&amp;#8212;kidnapper has likely done him a favor in preventing such an irksome fate. That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean he&amp;#8217;ll let her off easy. No one takes anything from a Viking that he&amp;#8217;s not willing to give...not even a violet-eyed vixen who sets off the wildest fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
