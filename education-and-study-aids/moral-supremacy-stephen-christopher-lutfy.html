  <title>Moral Supremacy - Stephen Christopher Lutfy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book I wrote in about a month time sums up how much I care about society in the United States. I hope as stated as many times before, that all human beings make it to Heaven and that we all will be in a State of Peace with God Our Holy Father. I also wrote this book because I wanted to make a difference in the world and make it a safe place like in the beginning where man was able to produce. As our trip of Pi would end when we were well enough to live on our own in our own vision. One humanity is a key part of what holds us together too. Meaning that we all are &amp;#39;one&amp;#39; viewed in our own consciousness. I believe that God will grant us Eternal Salvation for Moralities goods and services that have always driven us as human beings to want more and to work towards a goal. Lastly rather than letting immorality go unnoticed, it is always dire that you reject its notion and put an end to the chaos through fighting mentally as a warrior. I know many will not like what I say, but really if you understand yourself well enough you know that society is not a social construct but more as a place where one part of society tries taking over the other who do not want anything to do with then. And while this initially may not seem like the case, it is most certainly apparent in what I have written with 45,000 words in 67 pages declaring we need a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
