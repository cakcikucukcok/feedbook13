  <title>John the Jewish Gospel - Carroll Roberson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John is unique among the Gospels. It proclaims Christs love in a way the others do not. It also contains a different selection of miracles and teachings from our Lord. Most importantly, John places special focus on the complete and simultaneous divinity and humanity of Messiah. This is emphasized by the account being bookended between the powerful first chapter that reveals Christ as God the Creator and Johns nine-chapter retelling of the events surrounding Jesuss passion and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, Christianity has become dominated by well-meaning Gentile thought as the center of world culture has moved westward and anti-Semitic prejudice has become subtly more prevalent. As a result, we have missed the rich depth of so many truths by not reading the Gospel of John from his point of view of having walked and talked with his Jewish Messiah and God in the flesh. Most commentators approach Johns Gospel with a focus on expounding on the Greek language of the text. From this point, it is easy to wander into the realm of misunderstanding because Gentiles dissecting Gentile words leads to Gentile logic and analysis imposing itself on the fulfillment of the Jewish faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John the Jewish Gospel, Carroll Roberson invites the reader to get to know Jesus better by examining the text of John verse by verse and passage by passage from a first-century Jewish perspective. He does this with an open Old Testament and a wealth of biblical knowledge, study, and experience ready. Carroll pays special attention to messianic prophesy and details within the text that come alive when viewed with an understanding of the culture of the time. John the Jewish Gospel is a wonderful addition to the library of anyone who seeks to grow closer to Jesus the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;" />
