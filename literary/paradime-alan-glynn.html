  <title>Paradime - Alan Glynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Alan Glynn, the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Limitless, &lt;/i&gt;comes a novel of a twenty-first-century identity crisis that will thrill you from page one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Lynch didn&#39;t sign up for this, but right now, it&#39;s all he&#39;s got. Three weeks ago, he was working at a chow hall in Afghanistan and--more or less--doing fine. Sure, this meant living in a war zone, but he was never in the line of fire and, frankly, the money was hard to resist. Then Danny saw something he shouldn&#39;t have, and now he&#39;s back in New York City, haunted by what sent him home and lucky to be employed at all, even if that means dicing carrots for ten hours a day in a stuffy Midtown restaurant. The job&#39;s one saving grace? A sight line from his prep station in the kitchen to a coveted corner table in the main room. For Danny, this is a window into the lives of some of Barcadero&#39;s flashy clientele--and one evening, he sees a man who looks exactly like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teddy Trager is the visionary founder of the billion-dollar investment firm Paradime Capital. He has everything Danny never knew he wanted--cashmere suits, a sleek sports car . . . privilege, power--and the closer Danny looks at Trager the more fixated he becomes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
