  <title>The Gettysburg Nobody Knows - Gabor S. Boritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gabor Boritt has invited nine leading authorities to shed new light on the greatest battle in our history, focusing in particular on the unknown, the controversial, and what might have been. What did the battle do to the people of Gettysburg? What is behind the rise of Joshua Chamberlain to the status of the Hero of the Battle?  How did the common soldiers influence the battle? Readers are treated to a fresh account of Picketts Charge from the rarely-described perspective of the Union soldiers, and to careful new analyses of the battlefield actions of General Ewell and General Daniel Sickles. And throughout the volume, there is much vivid writing, such as a stirring account of the moment when General Winfield Scott Hancock ordered the First Minnesota to take those colors, sending the Minnesotans into a struggle that would cost most of them their lives but would help save the day for the Union.  Offering the insights of Americas eminent Civil War scholars, The Gettysburg Nobody Knows provides a marvelously informative reconsideration of this epic event." />
