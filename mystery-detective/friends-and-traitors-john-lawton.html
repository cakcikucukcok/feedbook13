  <title>Friends and Traitors - John Lawton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friends and Traitors&lt;/i&gt; marks Lawton’s return to his most popular series, the Inspector Troy novels, which have sold over 100,000 copies in the States alone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friends and Traitors&lt;/i&gt; has a fantastic plot, centering around disgraced spy Guy Burgess, incorporating the anti-homosexuality laws of the 1950s, the genteel but treacherous world of postwar Vienna, a fantastic love story between Troy and a potential &lt;i&gt;femme fatale&lt;/i&gt;, and a group of British spies leading dangerous double lives.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawton is beloved by crime columnists, from Adam Woog at the &lt;i&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/i&gt; to Patrick Anderson at the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, as well as by booksellers and other writers. We plan to try to make a big push with this book, including outreach to blurbers such as Joseph Kanon, John le Carré, Philip Kerr, Alan Furst, and William Boyd—top-class crime writers to which he has been compared by critics—to provide some fresh endorsements for this particularly strong title.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In connection with publication, Lawton will attend Bouchercon (in Toronto this year) and will be available for selected bookstore events in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawton was recently the subject of a profile in the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;—he is becoming even better known here. The novels have also taken off in France and are selling increasingly well in the U.K.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sales for the Wilderness books have been strong and steady, on par with the previous Troy, &lt;i&gt;A Lily of the Field&lt;/i&gt;. Lawton’s novels continue to backlist extremely well, selling over 10,000 copies in 2016 alone, and are available for large-scale promotions in print and e-book." />
