  <title>Those Who Are Wise Will Shine! - Michael L. Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taken from Daniel 12:3, &quot;Those Who Are Wise Will Shine&quot; uncovers God&#39;s awesome power at work in the lives of those He chose to bear His message of Redemption, from Adam to Christ. The lives of these faithful brightly shined forth with His presence in the face of a world full of darkness.  They knew He spoke to them, called them, and in turn, they were constrained to follow Him.  There is no better way to shine for the Lord than to know with determined faith, who He really is and that where He leads, you will faithfully follow!  These ancient pioneers of faith displayed just that!
 &lt;p&gt;
This work seeks to take the readers back to the basics of Redemption and Sanctification though the unfolding of the &quot;Redemptive Thread&quot; that links the blood lineage of our ancient forefathers to the rise of our Messiah, Jesus Christ. It ends with the joyous events still to come at His Second Advent.  From creation to the cross, redemption and sanctification are certainly defined as two of the zealous desires of the Lord.  The overall central theme of the Holy Scripture is redemption.  Humanity is fallen, separated from God, and in dire need of reconciliation.  The Lords perfect gift of redemption reconciles the breach.  His work in us is what follows. Immediately He begins that work, and it will never be complete until we see Him face-to-face!!  He calls us to be holy and set apart for His service.  Never underestimate the value He has placed on you as a vessel chosen with purpose to be His emissary shining His light into this dark world. It is Gods foundational will for each of us to emanate the fragrance of Christ in all He calls us to be.
&lt;p&gt;
Today, Christians in most places are still in need of the milk of the word.  They lead a very shallow and powerless Christian life.  It is one of the reasons the church is so lifeless in many places.  It is not enough to know of the elementary principles of Christianity, we must also understand their meaning in terms of God&#39;s continual work in us.  We must take them to heart. This volume seeks to lay a foundation of trusting God by understanding how God worked in the lives of past saints to make sure His message of redemption went unhindered so it could be ours today.  Millions in the past millennia have gone beyond the superficial and with God&#39;s help, stood firmly and boldly on His side! A proper understanding of Redemption will only lead you to rejoice with joy unspeakable as you stand in unrestricted service to God.  He has liberated us to fulfill our redemptive purpose.  He truly has set us free!  
&lt;p&gt;
Hebrews 13:9b teaches us, For it is good that the heart be established by grace...  The word established comes from ?a??? which means to be firm or secure, literally propped up, as in a stick holding up a tent.  If our heart is truly established by the true teaching of Grace, which comes from the nature of the Father, then when we fall, we still stand.  Rejoice in HimFor Redemption provides just that!" />
