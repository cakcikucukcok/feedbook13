  <title>Prettyboy Must Die - Kimberly Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A CIA prodigy&#39;s cover is blown when he accidentally becomes an internet sensation in &lt;i&gt;#Prettyboy Must Die&lt;/i&gt;, Kimberly Reid&#39;s fun, fast thriller inspired by the #Alexfromtarget story and perfect for fans of Alex Rider.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Peter Smith&#39;s classmate snaps a picture of him during a late night run at the track, Peter thinks he might be in trouble. When she posts that photo--along with the caption, &quot;See the Pretty Boy Run,&quot;--Peter knows he&#39;s in trouble. But when hostiles drop through the ceiling of his 6th period Chem Class, Peter&#39;s pretty sure his trouble just became a national emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he&#39;s not really Peter Smith. He&#39;s Jake Morrow, former foster-kid turned CIA operative. After a massive screw-up on his first mission, he&#39;s on a pity assignment, a dozen hit lists and now, social media, apparently. As #Prettyboy, of all freaking things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His cover&#39;s blown, his school&#39;s under siege, and if he screws up now, #Prettyboy will become #Deadboy faster than you can say, &#39;fifteen minutes of fame.&#39; Trapped in a high school with rabid killers and rabid fans, he&#39;ll need all his training and then some to save his job, his school and, oh yeah, his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
