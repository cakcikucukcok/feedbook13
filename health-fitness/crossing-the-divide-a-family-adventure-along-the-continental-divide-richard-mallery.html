  <title>Crossing the Divide: A Family Adventure Along the Continental Divide - Richard Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a compelling story of a historical family event. Three generations participated in one man&amp;#39;s 3,800 mile walk along North America&amp;#39;s Continental Divide from Mexico to Jasper, Alberta, Canada. Richard and Gaila Mallery tell the story from the dual perspective of the backcountry and the frontcountry. Most long-distance hikers leave their families for months to pursue their passion for the trail. This is a story of how one family took a different path one that allowed them to enjoy the adventure together. Crossing the Divide is not just a journey through a geographical area on foot, through some of the most spectacular country in North America, it is a journey that crosses many divides. A long trek is much more than distance on the ground; it is also a walk into time. You learn where months of walking take you mentally as well as physically. This book will allow you to explore the perception of distance as a foot traveler. The physical uncertainties of wilderness travel make you spiritually receptive and prompt you to listen to something beyond yourself. Unlike North America&amp;#39;s other long trails, the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail is still a work in progress. Readers will find the experiences of the Mallery Family during their journey, appealing, uplifting and entertaining." />
