  <title>Run - Ann Patchett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Engaging, surprising, provocative and moving...a thoroughly intelligent book, an intimate domestic drama that nonetheless deals with big issues touching us all: religion, race, class, politics and, above all else, family.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-- Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Ann Patchett comes an engrossing story of one family on one fateful night in Boston where secrets are unlocked and new bonds are formed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since their mother&#39;s death, Tip and Teddy Doyle have been raised by their loving possessive and ambitions father. As the former mayor of Boston, Bernard Doyle wants to see is sons in politics, a dream the boys have never shared. But when an argument in a blinding New England snowstorm inadvertently causes an accident that involves a stranger and her child, all Bernard Doyle cares about is his ability to keep his children--all his children--safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set over a period of twenty-four hours, &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt; takes us from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard to a home for retired Catholic Priests in downtown Boston. It shows us how worlds of privilege and poverty can coexist only blocks apart from each other, and how family can include people you&#39;ve never even met. As an in her bestselling novel, &lt;em&gt;Bel Canto&lt;/em&gt;, Ann Patchett illustrates the humanity that connects disparate lives, weaving several stories into one surprising and endlessly moving narrative. Suspenseful and stunningly executed, &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately a novel about secrets, duty, responsibility, and the lengths we will go to protect our children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
