  <title>Nepal - Kay Walls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a story of how one person can make a difference in peoples lives. We hear stories of doctors making a difference in the lives of patients, but Kay has made a difference in my life, and my patients!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Dr Suman S. Thapa. MBBS.MS.Ph.D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tilganga Inst of Ophthalmology. Head of N.G.E.C.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WISH FROM TRICIA LA VOICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you, I Wish Your Vision to Make a Difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was decorated in brilliant colors of the earth. Mountain tops reaching for the heavens, stones bursting in emerald greens, ruby reds and sparkling blues ,,, yet darkness was all to be seen by many. Miles away, a young women laid with color in one eye, darkness in the other, but an ability to see her power in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightness, stillness and patience ... remain calm, find your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people wore grand smiles on their faces and twinkles in their eyes. Clothed in colors of the rainbow, yet darkness was all to be seen by many. Miles away, a young women faced the life that challenged her, determined not to be defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightness, stillness and patience ... remain calm ... find the vision God granted you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disease, so capable to reverse, forged forward. Silence and ignorance feeding its hunger, robbed the beauty from so many. Yet miles away a woman of perseverance, courage and compassion dared to make a difference and found her vision. A woman capable of seeing the light, remaining still and patient, found her vision by giving others their vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land holds endless beauty. The people are endlessly beautiful. Beauty now seen by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you, I Wish your vision to make a difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Tricia La Voice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a truly uplifting story. Most of us spend our lives thinking of only taking care of ourselves and our immediate loved ones. Some people go that one step further, and do great things for others. Kay is one of those rare individuals, who have made a real difference to the lives of others. She had a vision, and it was her mental strength, in the face of her physical weakness, that made it possible for her dream to come true.&lt;/p&gt;
