  <title>To Be Continued in Heaven - Jerry Vornholt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will we really see our loved ones again in heaven?   What kind of relationship might we have with them if we do see them again? &lt;/p. 
&lt;p&gt;Following the death of his wife, Jerry Vornholt  received cards, letters and verbal words of comfort from many sources consoling him with advice that he will be with his wife again in heaven someday.  Those words became both a beacon of hope and a problematic hindrance in Jerrys painful journey through the wounds of grief.  He wants more than anything for those words to be true, but he could not help but wonder if that really will happen.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Those who are grieving over the loss of a close loved one will appreciate the heartfelt viewpoints and homespun stories that appear throughout To Be Continued in Heaven as Jerry searches for answers to these and many other questions following the heartbreaking loss of his wife and very best friend to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
