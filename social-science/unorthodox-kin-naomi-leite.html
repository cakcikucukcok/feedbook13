  <title>Unorthodox Kin - Naomi Leite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Unorthodox Kin&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is a groundbreaking exploration of identity, relatedness, and belonging in the context of profound global interconnection. Naomi Leite paints a poignant and graceful portrait of Portugal&amp;#39;s urban Marranos, who trace their ancestry to fifteenth-century Jews forcibly converted to Catholicism and now seek connection with the Jewish people at large. Their story raises questions fundamental to the human condition: how people come to identify with far-flung others; how some find glimmerings of mystical connection in a world said to be disenchanted; how identities are lived in practice and challenged in interaction; how the horizons of kinship expand in a globally interconnected era; and how feelings of relatedness emerge between strangers and gather strength over time. Focusing on mutual imaginings and face-to-face encounters between urban Marranos and the foreign Jewish tourists and outreach workers who travel to meet them, Leite draws on a decade of ethnographic research in Portugal to trace participants&amp;#39; perceptions of self, peoplehood, and belonging as they evolve through local and global social spaces. Methodologically innovative and written in a compelling narrative style,&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Unorthodox Kin&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is a model study in the anthropology of kinship, tourism, and globalization that will appeal to a wide readership.&lt;BR /&gt;" />
