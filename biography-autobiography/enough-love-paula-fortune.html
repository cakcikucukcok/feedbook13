  <title>Enough Love - Paula Fortune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enough Love&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of essays weaving together the brutally-honest story of one womans journey through depression, sexual promiscuity, avoidance of intimacy, fear of abandonment, marriage, divorce, and multiple suicide attempts to a place of self-love and joy. Including excerpts from her own personal journals between age ten to present day, Paula Fortune eloquently describes what her life was like, what she did to change it, and what it is like today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enough Love&lt;/i&gt; will enlighten the reader about the severity of sex and love addiction, a disease largely considered a joke by the media and public opinion. Light is shed on turning resentment into compassion, moving from atheism to faith, and healing the inevitable family-of-origin wounds. It is guaranteed to provide hope and inspiration to anyone suffering from low self-worth, addictive patterns, and relationship issues.&lt;/p&gt;" />
