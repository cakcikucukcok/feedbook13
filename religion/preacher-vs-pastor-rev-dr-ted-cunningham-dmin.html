  <title>Preacher Vs Pastor - Rev. Dr. Ted Cunningham Dmin.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Few Things a Young Preacher Needs to Know is not intended to be a step by step guide outlining all the things a Pastor/Preacher must do or be. Its intent is to furnish a few dos and donts that are essential to being a successful or good Preacher/Pastor. This is not to say that I am or was, or will be ... but to help some of you profit or learn from my mistakes and experience. Only God can make any of us an instrument for His glory, honor and praise, or to have us be what we were made for. Nothing I (we) want to do or can do, will cause His will to be done in the perfect way except to do it as He wants it done. 
My desire is that this will be easy reading and spark your interest even if you are not a minister/pastor or even contemplating anything.  Perhaps you are simply interested in knowing more about your church and leaders." />
