  <title>Impaled on the Horns of the Devil - Barbara Boatright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        With courageous confession, the author describes her high school romance, laced with parental opposition, the pull of premarital sex, and an awareness
        of guilt before God. After less than a year of marriage to her high school sweetheart, when she begins to recognize her parents concerns as valid, she
        meets a man who becomes a destructive force in her life. He encourages her to divorce her husband and instead, become dependent on him for emotional
        support. With painful honesty she relates how he gains manipulative control over her emotions and moral standards. She joins him in defying biblical
        commandments and societal conventions. Readers who have suffered through failed marriages will understand her struggles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The author winds up her memoir by observing what in her background contributes to vulnerability and control by a man who seems to represent the devil.
        She tells how she eventually escapes from him and an emotionally abusive second marriage. She offers insight to parents and teens about both positive
        and negative relationships between them, and how those relationships powerfully influence the lives and marital decisions of young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
