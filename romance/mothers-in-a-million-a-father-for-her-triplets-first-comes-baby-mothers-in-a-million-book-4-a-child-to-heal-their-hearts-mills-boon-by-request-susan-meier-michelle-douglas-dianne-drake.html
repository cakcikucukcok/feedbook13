          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Father for Her Triplets&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Meier&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Missy Johnson is single-handedly raising her triplets and running a wedding cake business – until Wyatt McKenzie returns to town. As she watches the gorgeous bachelor play with her lively brood Missy’s beginning to think that five is the perfect number!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Comes Baby…&lt;/em&gt; by Michelle Douglas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Best friends since childhood, Ben and Meg have always kept their relationship platonic – except for one unforgettable kiss. So when Meg decides to become a mother, Ben is happy to help but can he convince Meg that he’s more than a friend and ready to settle down?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Child to Heal their Hearts&lt;/em&gt; by Dianne Drake&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Childrens doctor Reid Adams has found a new sense of purpose after adopting twin girls, although it cost him his fiancé. Now prickly Keera Murphy arrives with an orphaned sickly child and they turn Reid’s life upside down, but he knows they’re meant to be together…as a family!&lt;/p&gt;
