  <title>New Love Poems - Terry Benczik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is love? How do we get and keep that almost indescribably happy feeling?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The collection, New Love Poems, by award-winning poet Terry Benczik moves with tenderness, sensitivity, and humor through love&#39;s many moods. The book reflects the wild adventure and charming idyll that romantic feelings provide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It describes a woman&#39;s journey of love through a jungle of emotions, from attraction and excitement through hurt, despair, longing, and hope. There are also portraits of feelings of love that soar and bring the reader to an elevated territory. The thoughts and feelings here are images and stories we might all recognize and cherish. Some poems spark sentiment, wistfulness, desire, and laughter. Other poems reflect love, not just for a romantic partner, but for humanity and the divine beloved; conveying a realization that the love we carry in our hearts is the most precious gift we can give to ourselves and to others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;Reading poetry awakens our own inner artisan energies and transforms us. New Love Poems is a treasure of blessing-filled healing poems for both heart and soul. Terry Benczik is truly Rumis daughter with her profound, authentic heart poetry.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
-Rev. Jayne Howard Feldman, author of Commune with the Angels, Driving Under the Influence of Angels, and Angels by My Side&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; &quot;Well, a rare combination of talents is our Terry Benczik! She is fully conscious of the joys of human lifethat &#39;pleasing, anxious being,&#39; as Thomas Gray so memorably described it; and simultaneously she is movingly mindful of Virgil&#39;s &#39;tears of things&#39;; (lacrimae rerum). Yet she somehow manages to suffuse a tender charm over both these aspects of our mortal experiences, both the weeping and the laughter. I&#39;m sure it is her aesthetic sensitivity which I find so appealing -that gentle power, that verbal elegance, that poignant memorability, which characterizes her poetic achievement.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
-Colin Dexter, creator, Inspector Morse&lt;/p&gt;
