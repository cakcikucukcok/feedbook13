  <title>Blueprints - Barbara Delinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blueprints, &lt;/i&gt;the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel from Barbara Delinsky, is the story of two strong women, Caroline MacAfee, a skilled carpenter, and her daughter Jamie, a talented architect. The day after her 56th birthday, Caroline is told the network wants Jamie to replace her as the host on &lt;i&gt;Gut It!&lt;/i&gt;, their family-based home construction TV show. The resulting rift couldn&#39;t come at a worse time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jamie, life changes overnight when, soon after learning of the host shift, her father and his new wife die in a car accident that orphans their two-year-old son. Accustomed to organization and planning, she is now grappling with a toddler who misses his parents, a fiancé who doesn&#39;t want the child, a staggering new attraction, and a work challenge that, if botched, could undermine the future of both MacAfee Homes and &lt;i&gt;Gut It!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Caroline, hosting &lt;i&gt;Gut It!&lt;/i&gt; is part of her identity. Facing its loss, she feels betrayed by her daughter and old in the eyes of the world. When her ex-husband dies, she is thrust into the role of caregiver to his aging father. And then there&#39;s Dean, a long-time friend, whose efforts to seduce her awaken desires that have been dormant for so long that she feels foreign to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who am I?&lt;/i&gt; Both women ask, as the blueprints they&#39;ve built their lives around suddenly need revising. While loyalties shift, decisions hover, and new relationships tempt, their challenge comes not only in remaking themselves, but in rebuilding their relationship with each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
