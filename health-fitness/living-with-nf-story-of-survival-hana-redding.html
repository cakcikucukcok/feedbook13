  <title>Living with Nf &amp; Story of Survival - Hana Redding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You never know how something that you think is so small can turn into chapters of the unknown. My parents thought they had a healthy daughter because I was born with ten fingers and ten toes, but they were dead wrong because on one particular day, when Mom was getting me dressed, she noticed small spots appearing all over my body. 
Mom became so concerned she rushed me to childrens hospital to be seen by the doctor. I was seen by the doctor right away. As he began to exam me, he had this strange look on his face, like what he had seen on my body was nothing like hed seen before. 
My mom began to cry again while asking the doctor, Is my daughter going to be okay? 
His response was Im not sure, but I think she might have NF, a rare genetic disorder. Some tests have to be run. Come back in one week, and we will know exactly whats going on. 
Upon arriving home, Dad was sitting on the couch and said, Whats up, bossy? It was a nickname my dad gave my mom. 
Her response in a loud tone of voice was Our daughter Hana might have NF. 
Dads response was What? Huh, whats that? 
Mom began to yell, You should have been there! Youre never around! 
All hell was about to break loose. I ran upstairs to my bedroom and slammed my door, still hearing my parents arguing back and forth." />
