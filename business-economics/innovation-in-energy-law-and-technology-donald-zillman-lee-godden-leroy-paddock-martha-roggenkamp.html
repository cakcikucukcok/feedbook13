  <title>Innovation in Energy Law and Technology - Donald Zillman, Lee Godden, LeRoy Paddock, Martha Roggenkamp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are few existential challenges more serious in the twenty first century than energy transition. As current trends in energy production prove unsustainable for the environment, energy security, and economic development, innovation becomes imperative. Yet, with technological challenges, come legal challenges. Zillman, Godden, Paddock, and Roggenkamp assemble a team of experts in their field to debate how the law may have to adapt to changes in the area. What
regulatory approach should be used? How do we deal with longer-term investment horizons and so called &#39;stranded assets&#39; such as coal-fired power stations? And can a form of energy justice be achieved which encompasses human rights, sustainable development goals, and the eradication of energy poverty?
With a concept as unwieldy as energy innovation, it is high time for a text tackling changes which are dynamic and diverse across different communities, and which provides a thorough examination of the legal ramifications of the most recent technological changes. This book which be of vital importance to lawyers, policy-makers, economists, and the general reader." />
