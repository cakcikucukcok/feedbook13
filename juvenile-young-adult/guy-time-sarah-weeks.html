  <title>Guy Time - Sarah Weeks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; It&#39;s bad enough that thirteen-year-old Guy Strang&#39;s parents are getting divorced and his middle-aged mother is suddenly acting like a rebellious teenager. But to top that off Autumn Hockney asks him out                                 to the movies. A year ago he would have known just what to say--&quot;No!&quot;--but for reasons that even he doesn&#39;t understand, he says &quot;Maybe.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; That&#39;s when Guy&#39;s troubles begin. Everybody&#39;s mad at him.                                 Autumn&#39;s larger-than-life best friend, Lana Zuckerman, will stop at nothing in her campaign to squeeze a definite &quot;Yes&quot; out of Guy, while Guy&#39;s best friend, Buzz, threatens to desert him forever if he goes soft. &lt;/p&gt;                                 &lt;p&gt; Guy can&#39;t afford to lose Buzz now, not when their brilliant plan to reunite his parent isn&#39;t going exactly as planned. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; In this sequel to her hilarious &lt;i&gt;Regular Guy&lt;/i&gt; Sarah                                 Weeks explored the very essence of early adolescence with sensitivity and her trademark sense of humor. &lt;/p&gt;" />
