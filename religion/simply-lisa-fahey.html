  <title>Simply. - Lisa Fahey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is full of distractions and chaos. As a result, we are pulled in many directions, making it difficult to find time to be together as families and to find rest. The world is tired and in search of happiness, but what if all it took to find joy was a way to live simply? And what if Gods Word provided us with the guidance to walk this path on our search for meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SimplyA Womens Study on Ecclesiastes, author Lisa Fahey invites her fellow women in Christ to join her in a study about the wisdom book of Ecclesiastes, where we can learn that the key to living life to the fullest is in living it simply. With encouraging words and advice, intimate biblical commentaries, and study activities where you can share your own reflections, Simply will walk you through the twelve timeless treasures found in the book of Ecclesiastes, and it will help you fill the void in your life with Gods guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling restless, overwhelmed, or like your life is becoming out of control, then turning to the book of Ecclesiastes will show you a way to find meaningfulness and simple, faithful encouragement in your life. Life is hard and messy, but after spending time in Ecclesiastes, you can discover that the treasure of living life to the fullest is by living it just simply.&lt;/p&gt;" />
