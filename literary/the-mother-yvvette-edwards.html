  <title>The Mother - Yvvette Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;A Cupboard Full of Coats &lt;/em&gt;makes her hardcover debut with a provocative and timely novel about an emotionally devastated mother&amp;#8217;s struggle to understand her teenage son&amp;#8217;s death, and her search for meaning and hope in the wake of incomprehensible loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unimaginable has happened to Marcia Williams. Her bright and beautiful sixteen-year-old son, Ryan, has been brutally murdered. Consumed by grief and rage, she must bridle her dark feelings and endure something no mother should ever have to experience: she must go to court for the trial of the killer&amp;#8212;another teenage boy&amp;#8212;accused of taking her son&amp;#8217;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could her son be dead? Ryan should have been safe&amp;#8212;he wasn&amp;#8217;t the kind of boy to find himself on the wrong end of a knife carried by a dangerous young man like Tyson Manley. But as the trial proceeds, Marcia finds her beliefs and assumptions challenged as she learns more about Ryan&amp;#8217;s death and Tyson&amp;#8217;s life, including his dysfunctional family. She also discovers troubling truths about her own. As the strain of Ryan&amp;#8217;s death tests their marriage, Lloydie, her husband, pulls farther away, hiding behind a wall of secrets that masks his grief, while Marcia draws closer to her sister, who is becoming her prime confidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person seems to hold the answers&amp;#8212;and the hope&amp;#8212;Marcia needs: Tyson&amp;#8217;s scared young girlfriend, Sweetie. But as this anguished mother has learned, nothing in life is certain. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful, engrossing novel that illuminates some of the most important and troubling issues of our time, &lt;em&gt;The Mother&lt;/em&gt;is a moving portrait of love, tragedy, and survival&amp;#8212;and the aftershocks from a momentary act of cruel violence that transforms the lives of everyone it touches.&lt;/p&gt;" />
