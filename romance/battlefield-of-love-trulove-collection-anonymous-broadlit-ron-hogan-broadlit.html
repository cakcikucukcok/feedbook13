  <title>Battlefield of Love: TruLOVE Collection - Anonymous-BroadLit, Ron Hogan, BroadLit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Soldiers and the Ones Who Love Them&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Love. War. Pain. Passion. Relationships lost. Romance rekindled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many generations of Americans have struggled with sending loved ones into battle and taking care of them when they return. Yet all of the stories in this collection have the same theme&amp;#8212;whether they are about World War II, Vietnam, or the Gulf War&amp;#8212;love is critical to our survival. It makes most, stronger. It makes some heroes. No matter if a soldier is fighting a &quot;good&quot; war, or a politically controversial war, there is little difference for their families who must remain brave and supportive both when they send their soldier into battle and when he or she returns injured physically or emotionally.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This TruLOVE Collection honors the brave men and women who have or are currently serving in America&#39;s armed forces and their loved ones. These stories about love are reminders of how much we invest, emotionally and culturally, in the men and women who serve the United States in uniform--and how important it is for us to champion them when they return from the front the same way we do when they set out to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of these stories are told from the woman&#39;s point of view; however, a few are from the man&#39;s point of view. All of the heroes and heroines in these stories learn valuable lessons about what is most important in their lives. We hope you find these stories heartwarming, inspiring and truly romantic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
