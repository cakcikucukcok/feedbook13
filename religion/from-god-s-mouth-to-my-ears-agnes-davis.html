  <title>From God’S Mouth to My Ears - Agnes Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was designed as a Daily Affirmation tool. I suggest that you select one each day, at random and you might find that it is the right one for whatever situation you are experiencing on that very day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to prayer and our quiet time with God, most of us simply want to talk -- to tell God about all of our hopes, desires, painful hurts and sorrows. While God desperately wants to hear from us, once in a great while someone comes along to remind us again that more of our time with God should be spent listening rather than talking. Agnes Davis has accomplished that in From Gods Mouth to My Ears. What a gift she has provided to us as she shares her deepest moments with God! I have found these brief devotionals to be uplifting, encouraging, and challenging. This is a much needed work that many of us have searched for for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
