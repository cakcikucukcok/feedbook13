  <title>Inglorious - Joanna Kavenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A darkly comic novel about a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown, set against the backdrop of a London awash with faithless lovers, cutthroat strivers, and so-called friends&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day successful young journalist and dedicated urbanite Rosa Lane sends her boss an e-mail that says &quot;I quit&quot; and then walks out of her job. She can&#39;t explain why--not to Liam, who&#39;s lived with her for years; not to her friends; not to her anxious, recently widowed father. All Rosa knows is that she needs to find enlightenment, to somehow understand her mother&#39;s death and do more than just earn her living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins the piercingly wise and bitingly funny odyssey of Rosa Lane. Along the way, she is deceived by her lover, evicted by her roommate, threatened by her bank manager, picked over by prospective employers, befuddled by philosophy, and tormented by omnivorous London. Brought very low indeed, Rosa in her desperation makes a final assault on those who have done her wrong, leading to the beginning of her return to normality--whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a remarkable fiction debut, Joanna Kavenna displays lacerating wit, a perfect eye for social hypocrisies, and great depths of compassion to create a triumphant modern heroine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
