  <title>Dead Dogs - Joe Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where I am now doesn&#39;t really matter. What matters is how I got here. How we, how me and Seán, saw that girl getting killed and all the stuff that happened after. And all the stuff that happened before. I saw her getting killed - I know I saw. Seán and me grew up in a town the rest of the world has closed its eyes to. The town we grew up in is a cartoon. A cartoon where we&#39;re the butt of every joke, the cloud of dust at the end of every falling anvil. Seán wasn&#39;t like the rest of us. Seán isn&#39;t like anyone. Seán does stuff to things, things like cats and dogs and guinea pigs. Bad stuff; he can&#39;t help it. Dead dogs and a murder. This is how I got here. I saw it happen. I really, really saw it. Dead Dogs is a novel like no other - odd, witty and darkly hilarious, full of pathos and suspense from the beginning to its taut and throttling crescendo. This is a genre-bending achievement by one of Ireland&#39;s most talented and original voices." />
