  <title>The Natural - Bernard Malamud, Kevin Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Introduction by Kevin Baker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Natural&lt;/i&gt;, Bernard Malamud&#39;s first novel, published in 1952, is also the first--and some would say still the best--novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material--the story of a superbly gifted &quot;natural&quot; at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era--and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin&#39;s comment still holds true: &quot;Malamud has done something which--now that he has done it!--looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
