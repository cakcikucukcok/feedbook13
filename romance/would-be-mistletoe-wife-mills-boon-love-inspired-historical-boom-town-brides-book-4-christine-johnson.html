  <title>Would-Be Mistletoe Wife (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Historical) (Boom Town Brides, Book 4) - Christine Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Mistletoe Match&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Worried she might lose her teaching job if funding is cut for her boarding school, widow Louise Smythe must consider marriage. But the only prospective groom in town is lighthouse keeper Jesse Hammond, and he wants children—something she may never be able to provide. While Jesse waits for the ideal woman to make his wife, though, Louise can’t help but long for something more than his friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If he wants to be promoted to head lighthouse keeper, Jesse needs to find a wife suited to his rustic lifestyle. But as he and Louise partner to give the town’s homeless orphans a joyous holiday, he’s drawn to the dainty woman. Will the light of Christmas finally inspire them to put their trust into each other’s hearts?&lt;/p&gt;
