  <title>The Nature of Things - Jeffrey R. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Were all asking the same kinds of questions, with the same goal in mind:&lt;br&gt;
How do I fit in? How can I navigate life gracefully? How can my life be more satisfying? How can I experience more love, joy, awe, and wonder? By learning, understanding, and applying the inherent wisdom that we find in the natural world, we can connect with people and with our planet, with our own hearts and souls, and create a life that is not only better for us as individuals, but perhaps together, create a world that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With simplicity and humor Jeff shows how the wisdom of nature can free us, untangle us from the complexity of our ego-driven lives. This is the wisdom of the ordinary for each of us to treasure. Allow these clear and profound teachings to awaken you, so that you can glimpse the divine that is within you and all around.&lt;br&gt;
Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee , Ph.D., Sufi teacher and author&lt;br&gt;
 like a friendly sharing across a backyard fence or an informal exchange of insights across a cup of coffee, Jeff Anderson has written...about the times we live in, the challenges we face, and the kind of life and consciousness that may help us not just survive but prosper.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
David Spangler, author of Apprenticed to Spirit and Facing the Future&lt;br&gt;
A thought-provoking, humorous and touching collection of truly helpful ideas.&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Edward Viljoen, author of Practice the Presence and Spirit Is Calling&lt;br&gt;
