  <title>Seduced by the Soldier - Melia Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zandra York just got her big break, photographing a major project for a travel magazine. So what if she&#39;s never traveled out of the country before? Or that she&#39;s more adept at deciphering fraudulent financial statements than reading German train schedules? Her brother Jackson is on his way to act as her guide, and she can&#39;t wait to experience Europe with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Jackson&#39;s overprotective best friend gets off the plane instead, Zandra knows this will not end well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There isn&#39;t a damned thing Special Forces instructor Blake Monroe wouldn&#39;t do for his best friend, but babysit Zandra when Jackson is unexpectedly called away on a mission? Nope. Not on the list. Especially not when she proves to be more trouble than he can handle--and far too tempting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between accidentally hiring a hearse as their rideshare, an unprovoked goat attack, and photographing erotic-shaped chocolates, Blake and Zandra can&#39;t keep their hands off each other. But Zandra&#39;s new career is about to send her all over the world and Blake is finally ready to settle down after his next deployment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;ll never ask her to give up her dreams. And she&#39;ll never ask him to give up his.&lt;/p&gt;" />
