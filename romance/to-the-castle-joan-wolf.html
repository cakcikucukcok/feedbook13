  <title>To The Castle - Joan Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Twelfth-century Normandy–as a fierce battle for the crown erupts, a powerful knight and his innocent bride will discover their destinies are passionately entwined….&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just weeks away from taking her holy &lt;em&gt;vows,&lt;/em&gt; Nell de Bonvile learns of her elder sister&#39;s tragic death. Swept from the convent, she is ordered to take Sybilla&#39;s place as bride to Roger de Roche, heir to Britain&#39;s most powerful earldom. Lovely, naive and totally unprepared for life outside the convent or the ways of men, Nell bravely faces her uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Indifferent to marriage for anything other than political gain, Roger is prepared to wait until his innocent bride comes to him willingly. Yet as he watches Nell blossom from timid girl to courageous mistress of his keep, his desire for her grows all-consuming. But war gives no quarter to newfound passion, plunging them both into a battle that will pit father against son, invaders against loyalists, testing every whispered word, and each unspoken promise….&lt;/p&gt;
