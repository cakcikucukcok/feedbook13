  <title>Born to FREAK:  A Salty Primer for Irrepressible Humans - Sarah Bamford Seidelmann MD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the help of Alice the Elephant, I came to the realization somewhat late in life that I was born to FREAK. It is my dream that by confessing my own strangeness and sharing tales of epic FREAKY awesomeness, other irrepressible humans might get the memo earlier in their lives that they, too, were born to FREAK.  Through my personal work and my work with clients and groups, I&#39;ve made so many connections between ADD, high sensitivity, Asperger&#39;s syndrome, autism, addicts of every kind (sex, drugs, alcohol, gambling, shopping), depressed/anxious/manic people, intense people, change agents, black sheep, adrenaline junkies, irrepressibles, rebels, bohemians, life pirates, bad asses, artists, innovators, performers, comedians, and healers ... and I believe we were all born to FREAK. We were all put here not to fit in, but to see things differently, to ruffle feathers, and to return balance to the world and our communities by using our creative abilities, our healing presence, and our eccentric gifts." />
