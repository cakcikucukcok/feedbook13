  <title>Cattle Kate - Jana Bommersbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cattle Kate is the only woman ever lynched as a cattle rustler. History called it &quot;range land justice&quot; when she was strung up in Wyoming Territory on July 20, 1889, tarring her as a dirty thief and a filthy whore.  But history was wrong. It was all a lie.  Her real name was Ella Watson. She wasn&#39;t a rustler. She wasn&#39;t a whore. And she&#39;d never been called Cattle Kate until she was dead and they needed an excuse. She was really a 29-year-old immigrant homesteader, lynched with her husband by her rich and powerful cattle-baron neighbors who wanted her land and its precious water rights.  Some people knew the truth from the start. Their voices were drowned out by the all-powerful Wyoming Stock Growers Association. And those who dared speak out-including the eyewitnesses to the hangings-either disappeared or mysteriously died. There was no one left to testify against the vigilantes when the case eventually came to trial. Her six killers walked away scot-free.  But the legend was stronger than the truth. For over a century, newspapers, magazines, books-movies,too-spread her ugly legacy.  Now, on the 125th anniversary of her murder, the real Ella comes alive in Cattle Kate to tell her heartbreaking story. Jana Bommersbach&#39;s debut novel bares a legend central to the western experience." />
