  <title>CANADIAN FAIRY TALES - 26 Illustrated Native American Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Prof. Cyrus Macmillian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 26 tales in this collection, were gathered from various parts of Canada&amp;mdash;at a time when the most convenient method of travel was by the Canadian waterways. The compiler travelled the rivers, lakes and oceans where sailors and fishermen still watched the stars. He gathered them in forest clearings where lumbermen still retained remnants of the old and now vanished way of life; where Indians used to barter for their goods and from remote country places where women spin and speak with reverence of the days of their fathers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 26 tales in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
How Glooskap Made The Birds&lt;br /&gt;
The Rabbit And The Grain Buyers&lt;br /&gt;
Saint Nicholas And The Children&lt;br /&gt;
The Fall Of The Spider Man&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Who Was Called Thick-Head&lt;br /&gt;
Rabbit And The Indian Chief&lt;br /&gt;
Great Heart And The Three Tests&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Of The Red Twilight Sky&lt;br /&gt;
How Raven Brought Fire To The Indians&lt;br /&gt;
The Girl Who Always Cried&lt;br /&gt;
Ermine And The Hunter&lt;br /&gt;
How Rabbit Deceived Fox&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy And The Dragon&lt;br /&gt;
Owl With The Great Head And Eyes&lt;br /&gt;
The Tobacco Fairy From The Blue Hills&lt;br /&gt;
Rainbow And The Autumn Leaves&lt;br /&gt;
Rabbit And The Moon-Man&lt;br /&gt;
The Children With One Eye&lt;br /&gt;
The Giant With The Grey Feathers&lt;br /&gt;
The Cruel Stepmother&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Who Was Saved By Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
The Song-Bird And The Healing Waters&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Who Overcame The Giants&lt;br /&gt;
The Youth And The Dog-Dance&lt;br /&gt;
Sparrow&amp;#39;s Search For The Rain&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy In The Land Of Shadows&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The skeleton of each story has been left for the most part unchanged, although the languages differ somewhat from that of the story-tellers from whose lips the writer heard them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fairy tales make a universal appeal both to old and young; to the young because it is the fantasy world into which they can retreat, and to the old because they are conscious again of the spirit of youth as they read such tales to their children and grandchildren, and rejoice in the illusion that after all there is not a great difference of age which separates the generations.&lt;br /&gt;
