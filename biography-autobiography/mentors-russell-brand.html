  <title>Mentors - Russell Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russell Brand explores the idea of mentoring and shares what he&#39;s learned from the guidance of his own helpers, heroes and mentors.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could happiness lie in helping others and being open to accepting help yourself? &lt;i&gt;Mentors &lt;/i&gt;- the follow up to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Recovery &lt;/i&gt;- describes the benefits of seeking and offering help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have mentors in every area of my life, as a comic, a dad, a recovering drug addict, a spiritual being and as a man who believes that we, as individuals and the great globe itself, are works in progress and that through a chain of mentorship we can improve individually and globally, together . . . One of the unexpected advantages my drug addiction granted is that the process of recovery that I practise includes a mentorship tradition. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I will encourage you to find mentors of your own and explain how you may better use the ones you already have. Furthermore, I will tell you about my experiences mentoring others and how invaluable that has been on my ongoing journey to self-acceptance and how it has helped me to transform from a bewildered and volatile vagabond to a (mostly) present and (usually) focussed husband and father.&quot;--&lt;/i&gt;Russell Brand &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped&lt;/i&gt; describes the impact that a series of significant people have had on the author - from the wayward youths he tried to emulate growing up in Essex, through the first ex-junkie sage, to the people he turns to today to help him be a better father. It explores how we all - consciously and unconsciously - choose guides, mentors and heroes throughout our lives and examines the new perspectives they can bring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
