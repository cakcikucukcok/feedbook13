  <title>A Chimpanzee in the Wine Cellar - Patricia Cavendish O&#39;Neil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the international best-selling author of A Lion in the Bedroom, Pat Cavendish O&#39;Neill, comes another glimpse into her extravagant and adventurous life ... In 1968, Pat Cavendish O&#39;Neill reluctantly left her magical years in Kenya behind to join her mother in Somerset West, South Africa. She left behind her wonderful friends, a life she loved and, even more heart-breaking, her beloved lioness Tana. However, arriving at her new home on Broadlands Farm, Pat soon found a different channel for her extraordinary gift with animals when she revealed a sharp eye for identifying winning race horses, turning Broadlands into a renowned stud farm. As always, the women attracted a colourful international audience into their extremely lavish lifestyle - champagne and caviar were the order of the day - and Pat and her mother would regularly fly to Australia to bid on some of the world&#39;s finest fillies and colts. Pat&#39;s fierce of love of animals has resulted in her opening heart and home to a variety of creatures, from monkeys to baboons, birds, sheep, pigs and horses, to a pack of seventeen dogs and a goat all living underfoot. But a rescued chimp named Kalu found his way deepest into her heart. For over 40 years Pat and Kalu have lived at Broadlands together and the one without the other is a picture incomplete. Today, at the age of 87, Pat leads a very different life from the enormous privilege and wealth into which she was born, yet she still remains true to her first love of animals." />
