  <title>My Heart&#39;s Desire - Heather Thorpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetry book called My Hearts Desire is a reflection of my love and adoration for Jesus and for the Jewish people of Israel. In 2001, while visiting Jerusalem with my mother, it was in the garden of Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives that I felt such an overwhelming sense of Gods unquestionable love for mankind and a deeper truth within my spirit that through his death, burial, and mighty resurrection, I exist and truly live and breathe and have my being. Shortly after returning from Jerusalem, I began to be awakened through the night with a stirring in my heart to write spiritual poems. It is my hearts desire that through these poems, you will be encourage, blessed, and touched in a deeper measure of the love of God and for the apple of his eye, the nation of Jerusalem.
All proceeds from this poetry book will be donated to the international fellowship of Christians and Jews to help bring the Jewish people back to their home landIsrael." />
