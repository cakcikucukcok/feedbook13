  <title>Grief, Golf, and Reinvention - Mick Rothman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grief, Golf and Reinvention,&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring story of a retired man who suddenly finds himself widowed, alone and needing to define his new life. It is a story about the long journey from shattered pieces, through acceptance, to renewal, strength, and personal reinvention. It is an absorbing, quirky, and amazing journey from loss to a new normal, with the love of friends &amp; family, a beginners mind, and the regularity and peace to be found in the wonderful game of golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mick Rothmans beautifully written book is as therapeutic as it is fascinating. I found it impossible to put down as it drew me into his lifes sudden crossroad. His emotional honesty is truly admirable and his journey extraordinary.&lt;/br&gt; 
Ron Perlman, Ph.D.&lt;/br&gt;
President, The Center: Resources for Teaching and Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well written and very entertaining. An excellent illustration of the importance of meaningful activities and meaningful relationships in a persons life during a time of loss.&lt;/br&gt;
Kim A. Meyer, Ph.D., BCBA-D&lt;/br&gt;
Clinical Psychologist and Board Certified Behavior Analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will be helpful to men who find grief and grieving unmanly. On the other hand, as a woman, this is very insightful into how a man processes emotion differently than a woman. A much-needed guide to finding our emotional comfort through the process of grief.&lt;/br&gt;
