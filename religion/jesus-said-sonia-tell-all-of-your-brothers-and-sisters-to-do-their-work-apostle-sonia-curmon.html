  <title>Jesus Said, “Sonia Tell All of Your Brothers and Sisters to Do Their Work.” - Apostle Sonia Curmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about a woman who died and was given a task from God. She was allowed to come back from death to deliver Gods directive to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im writing this book for two reasons. The first is to tell all believers in the church of Jesus Christ to do your works while it is day, for when night comes, no man will be able to work. Only what we do for Christ will last. When we die, we can only take our work for Jesus with us. Naked we came into the world, and naked we will leave this world. Hebrews 9:27 says, And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is to honor my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave this book to the next generation. We have a great inheritance through Jesus our Lord and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As the angel was escorting me back to earth; I heard Jesus call my name while I was in mid air, and when I looked back Jesus was standing on the clouds. His hair was long and white as the clouds, His hair was blowing in the wind. And He spoke these words to me, Sonia, tell all your Sisters and Brothers I said to do their Work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
