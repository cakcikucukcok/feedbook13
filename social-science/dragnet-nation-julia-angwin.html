  <title>Dragnet Nation - Julia Angwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inside look at who&#39;s watching you, what they know and why it matters. We are being watched.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see online ads from websites we&#39;ve visited, long after we&#39;ve moved on to other interests. Our smartphones and cars transmit our location, enabling us to know what&#39;s in the neighborhood but also enabling others to track us. And the federal government, we recently learned, has been conducting a massive data-gathering surveillance operation across the Internet and on our phone lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Dragnet Nation&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning investigative journalist Julia Angwin reports from the front lines of America&#39;s surveillance economy, offering a revelatory and unsettling look at how the government, private companies, and even criminals use technology to indiscriminately sweep up vast amounts of our personal data. In a world where we can be watched in our own homes, where we can no longer keep secrets, and where we can be impersonated, financially manipulated, or even placed in a police lineup, Angwin argues that the greatest long-term danger is that we start to internalize the surveillance and censor our words and thoughts, until we lose the very freedom that makes us unique individuals. Appalled at such a prospect, Angwin conducts a series of experiments to try to protect herself, ranging from quitting Google to carrying a &quot;burner&quot; phone, showing how difficult it is for an average citizen to resist the dragnets&#39; reach.&lt;br&gt;Her book is a cautionary tale for all of us, with profound implications for our values, our society, and our very selves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
