  <title>The Second Coming of Jesus - Think Again - William H. Hogue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The overarching theme of this book is that the Second Coming of Jesus happened in AD 72, and that therefore Jesus is not coming again to rapture the church. 
The book lays out a thorough exploration in support of this theme. Daniels prophecies are foundational, especially his prophecy of the Seventy Weeks in Daniel 9:2427 and his prophecy of four sequential Fertile-Crescent, Mediterranean empires (see Daniel 7). 
The Fourth Empire, or the Roman Empire, is the key to understanding my theme, with stress on the meaning of the horns on the head of the Fourth Beast (see Daniel 7:78). 
As proof of my theme, I use the biblical code of two or three witnesses (see, e.g., Deuteronomy 19:15, Matthew 18:16, John 8:17, and 1 John 5:8). The three witnesses I give are Daniel, Jesus, and the collective apostlesall of whom taught and agreed that Jesuss Second Coming would take place before Jesuss generation passed away (Matthew 24:34). 
Furthermore, I show how the epistles of the New Testament reflect this theme by citing scores of passages from them for my readers to consider. 
Finally, in chapter 5 of the book and in five appendixes, I show how the Book of Revelation, aptly interpreted, fully agrees with this theme." />
