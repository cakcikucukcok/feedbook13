  <title>The Power of Purpose in Life - Krishna Ganesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is written to emphasize the importance of having a purpose in ones life. Life, after all, must be led happily and having a purposeful life ensures happiness. The current unrest and gloom in the society are because of the fact that people do not have definite goals in life. The mind, by nature, is negative and requires conscious effort to turn positive. A strong purpose in life engages the mind constructively and turns it positive, thus bringing plenty of joy and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
However, finding purpose in ones life is not easy. It involves serious introspection, as questioning oneself is the only way to find it. But it is worth making an attempt as our self-esteem and happiness in life are directly linked to it. The book brings out the information about ones natural abilities and explains how they have connections with ones passion. So discovering either natural abilities or passion or both would eventually lead to the purpose of life. This book gives more insight into the relationship between them and describes how a strong purpose in life has the ability to make life joyful. The examples given in the book can help serious readers to find theirs. &lt;/p&gt;
All the people who made it big in life have used their inherent abilities and passion to bring success to themselves. This book captures their inspiring stories to make the readers aware of the potential of having a strong purpose in life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
