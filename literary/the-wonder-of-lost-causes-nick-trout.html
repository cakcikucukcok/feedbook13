It&amp;#8217;s a tough call, but she&amp;#8217;s a single mom taking care of a kid who fights for every breath he takes. The daily medical routine that keeps Jasper alive is complicated enough. Worse still, Kate&amp;#8217;s personal resolve runs contrary to her work as the veterinarian in charge of a Cape Cod animal shelter, where she is on a mission to find forever homes for dogs in desperate need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scarred, mistreated wreck of a dog that turns up doesn&amp;#8217;t stand a chance. Named Whistler, he&amp;#8217;s too old, too ugly. But the dog forms an instantaneous bond with Jasper. Whistler never makes a sound, yet he speaks to Jasper in a myriad of mysterious ways. The clock&amp;#8217;s ticking, the dog&amp;#8217;s future hangs in the balance, and Jasper would do anything to find him a home; but Whistler has chosen them&amp;#8212;for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;" />
