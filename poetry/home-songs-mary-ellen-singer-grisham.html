  <title>Home Songs - Mary-Ellen Singer Grisham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As we journey through life, we become a part of every place we liveand each place becomes a part of us.  Some folks collect snapshots and photos into a series of albums that record the human experience of each place.  In Home Songs, I capture and record the experiences of home places in words.  There are people and experiences too good to be forgotten, and I have attempted to remember and write about the best of these from each period in my life.  In doing so, I believe I have captured stories that are universal and timeless.
     Also, at each stage of our life journey, there are feelings, insights, ideas, and beliefs that characterize that stage of development.  At times, these growing understandings can best be expressed in fictional stories.  These stories reveal who we are and who we are becoming.
These stories explore the difficulties, challenges, and joys of our lives and help to give universal meaning to our individual life journey.
     I hope that you enjoy my life stories and that in reading mine, you remember, re-live, and enjoy your own.  Perhaps there is true kinship in the emotional journeys of the heart." />
