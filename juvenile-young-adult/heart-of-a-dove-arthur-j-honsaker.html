  <title>Heart of a Dove - Arthur J. Honsaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Heart of a dove was conceived early one morning while I was sitting on my patio, enjoying my coffee and watching the little birds chirping and seemingly at play. The due was thick and rising when I noticed, that through the branches, a pretty little bird was perched looking at me, for an unusually long period of time. I began talking to him, as if he could understand what I was saying. Good morning, I said with a smile. Why are you just setting there looking at me? Go play with your friends and have some fun. By the time I finished writing, Heart of a Dove, I realized that it was the story of my life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a book about the conversation between a man and bird, one in the same, authored to minister to both the heart of the reader and to the tender hearts of our children, who are our future and need to know the love of the Lord Jesus, as soon as possible. The pretty little bird does know who he is, or what he believes as he begins to cry he asked himself, what kind of stupid bird am I? I cannot sing or fly! By the end of the story he is singing, I can fly I can fly, look at me grandpa, I can fly!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dear Lord Jesus, please use this book as a tool to mold and carve your love and understanding in our hearts and minds.&lt;/P&gt;" />
