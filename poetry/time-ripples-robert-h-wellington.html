  <title>Time Ripples - Robert H. Wellington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Time Ripples is a gift of love for those who find their way to its pages. Through poetry, prose and essay it addresses many of the issues and circumstances we all encounter during our daily journeys. Many of life&amp;rsquo;s gifts and challenges are dealt with on the pages of this book, which is offered as a companion or friend to accompany us as we weave our way together through this reality. Though it does not always seem so, this is a journey to be enjoyed. Remember that it is only for a brief moment that we find ourselves here, before our Soul directs us to another adventure, a new experience of ever increasing purity and reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s great plan. The deep mystery, which we all know at a certain level, but have forgotten, is that we are an intimate part of this plan, co-creators of our own reality. And as co-creators, we are wholly capable of healing its inconsistencies and other miscreation resulting from confused thoughts and foggy sight. Time Ripples is comprised of thoughts and inspirations which occurred to the author during meditation and prayer over many years. We all have access to these ideas. We have only to quiet the noisy confusion of our minds through patient meditation and ultimately, contemplation. The poems and essays contained herein are presented as meditative seed thoughts which can be used by the reader, along with their own inspirations, to find a place of peace within, so that each day can be a reminder of our intimate and critical place in God&amp;rsquo;s created cosmos. As Kahlil Gibran points out in his classic The Prophet, we are, &amp;ldquo;boundless drops in a boundless ocean.&amp;rdquo; We are all critical to the ever expanding tapestry of creation. The loss of even one Soul leaves a gaping hole in this tapestry and we all play a part in its healing for we are inseparably connected. You are invited to travel a while with us through these pages, and in so doing, add your own precious Ripples in Time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
