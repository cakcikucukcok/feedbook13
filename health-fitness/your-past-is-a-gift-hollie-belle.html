When you can understand the value of each experience that you have had in your life, then and only then can your life take off.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this unique work, Your Past is a Gift, you will learn:&lt;/P&gt;
 Who you truly are&lt;/br&gt;
 The purpose of your relationships&lt;/br&gt;
 How to learn from your mistakes, rather than avoiding them&lt;/br&gt;
 Whats holding you back from living the life you always dreamed of having&lt;/br&gt;
 Why you are angry or frustrated all the time&lt;/br&gt;
 The truth about your money issues&lt;/br&gt;
 Why you keep sabotaging your best efforts to be happy&lt;/br&gt;
 The reason you feel alone, regardless of how many people you have in your life&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hollie Belle invites you to use this book as your journal, start the process today, and fall in love with your life. You deserve to be happy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
