  <title>He Opens Another Door - Deepak Sethi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Destiny forces an Indian Army Brigadier to quit his promising career after 31 years service. He starts afresh by joining the PhD program at the University
    of Texas at Dallas, and completes it in three years, this too in very dramatic circumstances. Then he goes on to teach at three American universities and
    makes a mark in his second innings too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    But this gripping account is not merely about his transition into U.S. academia. It traces his lifes journey, on either side of the time and space divide,
    and the manner in which he deals with various twists, troubles, and triumphs that His Grand Schema orchestrated for him. Equally fascinating is its
    overview of the cultural, social, and military milieu in India, now a strategic partner in the emerging geopolitical dynamic.
