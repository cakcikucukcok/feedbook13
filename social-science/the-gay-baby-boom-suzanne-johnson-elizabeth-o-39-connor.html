  <title>The Gay Baby Boom - Suzanne Johnson, Elizabeth O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The gay and lesbian community is experiencing a baby boom. Advances in gay rights coupled with increased availability of alternative reproduction techniques have led to an unprecedented number of openly gay and lesbian parents. Estimates are that between 6 and 14 million children in the United States are being raised by at least one parent who is gay. Yet, very little is known about how gay or lesbian headed families function, or whether they differ in any relevant ways from families headed by straight parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written by two developmental psychologists, &lt;ti1&gt;The Gay Baby Boom&lt;/ti1&gt; reports the findings of The Gay and Lesbian Family Study, the largest national assessment of gay and lesbian headed families. By asking participants detailed questions about the way they parent, the authors are able to describe for the first time exactly what takes place within gay and lesbian headed families across the county. Traditional research has tended to assume that there is something uniquely different and potentially psychologically damaging about children being raised by gays. The authors draw on their data to show these fears unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;" />
