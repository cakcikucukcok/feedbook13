  <title>One Summer at The Villa: The Prince&#39;s Royal Concubine / Her Italian Soldier / A Devilishly Dark Deal (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Lynn Raye Harris, Rebecca Winters, Maggie Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Prince’s Royal Concubine&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prince Cristiano di Savaré hunts his prey by ruthless means. Tonight’s pickings…Antonella Romanelli, crown princess of a rival country and part of a dynasty he has every reason to despise… …one majestic seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Antonella is rocked by Cristiano’s unexpected magnetism. But there’s ice in his wolfish smile… She’s far from the promiscuous, spoiled socialite he believes her to be, but Cristiano is here to persuade her into compliance. If bedding her is what it takes, then it will make his mission all the more pleasurable…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Her Italian Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Plucked from obscurity to model in an exciting campaign on the Amalfi coast, Annabelle Marsh can’t wait for her month away! Surely when she’s surrounded by so much natural beauty her emotional bruises can’t help but recover?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, she’s planned to heal her wounds in private – sharing accommodation with a darkly brooding, battle-scarred army pilot is not on the agenda! Ex-nurse Annabelle is compelled to help Lucca, even though he’s got ‘keep out’ written all over him. But once the spark between them ignites, it’s impossible to put out…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Devilishly Dark Deal&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having made his fortune from nothing, billionaire Marco Aguilar has wiped the dirt of a poverty-stricken childhood from his expensive shoes. Now he can have anything he wants – and his next acquisition is beautiful charity worker Grace Faulkner. He’ll finance her beloved orphanage if she agrees to become his mistress!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only Grace’s sweet, selfless nature – and the fire she ignites with her touch – shakes his iron defences to the core. Tortured Marco has been driven by demons for so long – can he be saved by this innocent angel?&lt;/p&gt;
