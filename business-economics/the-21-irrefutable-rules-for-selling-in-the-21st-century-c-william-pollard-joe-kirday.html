&lt;div&gt;During the years I served as a senior officer and then Chairman and CEO of ServiceMaster, I had the privilege and opportunity of working with Joe Kirday and seeing him grow as a manager, salesperson, and executive. He knows what it means to make the sale and to develop meaningful relationships of trust with customers. This book reflects the wisdom of someone who not only has the knowledge of selling, but also one who has made it happen. C. William Pollard Chairman and CEO (Ret) The ServiceMaster Company Over the past 25 years I have had the privilege to work with Joe Kirday. Joe has always been an executive within our ServiceMaster organization who can get results and make the sale. In this book, you will learn about the ways that Joes sells with his hands, head and heart. It is a great book that will give you an opportunity to learn some very powerful tools to make the sale. Mike Isakson President and COO ServiceMaster Franchise Group Even though I am not officially a sales person, still I learned a lot about the basic principles of selling through reading Joe&#39;s delightful book. I believe the principles he puts forward are irrefutable. Selflessness and a desire to meet the needs of others are basic for all jobs and professions. I heartily recommend this book to all who would like to improve their lives and their bottom line. Dr. David King (Th.D.) Pastor and Southern Baptist Missionary to Lebanon&lt;/div&gt;
