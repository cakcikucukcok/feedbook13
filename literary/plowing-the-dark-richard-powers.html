  <title>Plowing the Dark - Richard Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A dazzling new novel by the author of &lt;i&gt;Galatea 2.2 &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Gain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a digital laboratory on the shores of Puget Sound, a band of virtual-reality researchers races to complete the Cavern, an empty white room that can become a jungle, a painting, or a vast Byzantine cathedral. In a war-torn Mediterranean city, an American is held hostage, chained to a radiator in another empty white room. What can possibly join these two remote places? Only the shared imagination, a room that these people unwittingly build in common, where they are all about to meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adie Klarpol, a skilled but disillusioned artist, comes back to life, revived by the thrill of working with cutting-edge technology. Against the collapse of Cold War empires and the fall of the Berlin Wall, she retreats dangerously into the cyber-realities she has been hired to create. On the other side of the globe, Taimur Martin, an English teacher recovering from a failed love affair, is picked up off the streets in Beirut by Islamic fundamentalists and held in solitary captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mesmerizing fiction that explores the imagination&#39;s power to both destroy and save, &lt;i&gt;Plowing the Dark &lt;/i&gt;recasts the rules of the novel and stands as Richard Powers&#39;s most daring work to date.&lt;/p&gt;" />
