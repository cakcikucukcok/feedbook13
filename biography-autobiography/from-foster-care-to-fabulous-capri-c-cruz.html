  <title>From Foster Care to Fabulous - Capri C. Cruz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the creator of the philosophy foster children are fabulous champions, author and previous foster child herself, Capri Cruz, shows us how to overcome childhood trauma by implementing the effective healing strategies shes used throughout her life of turmoil, which ultimately catapulted her voyage From Foster Care to Fabulous. As an authority in the psychology of emotional healing, she presents techniques to initiate profound subconscious and spiritual transformation, which include perception realignment, inner-mind awakening, and the art of surrendering. 
Although designed with the foster child in mind, this book is a must read for all as it addresses two fundamental threads encompassing humanity: the human experience and the interpretation of that experience. The effects of negative childhood experiences often linger with lasting toxicity, which confines the mind to constricted and often unforgiving ideals birthed thereafter. Capri shows us that no longer has to be true! Its time to let the inner healing begin as she peels back the layers to reveal secrets for reprocessing damaging experiences. The simplicity of it is astonishing. 
By disassembling damaging experiences from childhood abuse to adulthood divorce, then analyzing them through the lens of wisdom revealed within these pages, and reconstructing subsequent perceptions, dynamic change in the trajectory of your life will be imminent. Tie this in with knowledge of deliberate creation and the master piece called your future becomes limitless as pain gets transformed to freedom!
Time waits for no one! The sand in the hour glass of life continues to slip away, whether we are mindful of it or not. Thus, let urgency lead the way as you journey into her world for a fresh look at what IS possible. I assure you, the quality of your life depends on it!
The healing work within is the seed for the guaranteed reward without." />
