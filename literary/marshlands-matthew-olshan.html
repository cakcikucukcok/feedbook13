  <title>Marshlands - Matthew Olshan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A first novel of considerable maturity: powerful, original, cunningly constructed, and timely.&quot; --Julian Barnes, author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sense of an Ending&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;After years alone in a cell, an aging prisoner is released without explanation, expelled into a great city now utterly unfamiliar to him. Broken by years of brutality at the hands of the prison guards, he scrounges for scraps, sleeping wild, until a museum curator rescues him from an assault. The museum has just opened its most controversial exhibit: a perfect replica of the marshes, an expansive wilderness still wracked by conflict. There the man had spent years as a doctor among the hated and feared marshmen, who have been colonized but never conquered.&lt;br&gt;     Then &lt;i&gt;Marshlands &lt;/i&gt;reveals one of its many surprises: it is written in reverse. The novel leaps backward once, twice, returning to the marshes and unraveling time to reveal the doctor&#39;s ambiguous relationship to the austerely beautiful land and its people. As the pieces of his past come together, a great crime and its consequences begin to take shape. The true nature of the crime and who committed it will be saved for the breathtaking ending--or, rather, for the beginning.&lt;br&gt;     In the tradition of Wilfred Thesiger&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Marsh Arabs &lt;/i&gt;and J. M. Coetzee&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Waiting for the Barbarians&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Marshlands&lt;/i&gt; explores a culture virtually snuffed out under Saddam Hussein, and how we cement our identities by pointing at someone to call &quot;other.&quot; Elegant, brief, and searing, Matthew Olshan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Marshlands&lt;/i&gt; shivers with the life of a fragile, lost world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
