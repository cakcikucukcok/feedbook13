  <title>Happily and Madly - Alexis Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexis Bass&#39; &lt;i&gt;Happily and Madly&lt;/i&gt; is a mature, twisty, compulsively readable YA suspense novel about a young girl who embraces a fate bound in love and mystery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Maris Brown has been told two things about her destiny:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. She will fall happily and madly in love.&lt;br&gt;2. She could be dead before she turns eighteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summer before that fateful birthday, Maris is in the wealthy beach town of Cross Cove with her estranged father and his new family--and the infamous Duvals. Since the youngest member of the Duval family, Edison, is back from college and back in the arms of Maris&#39;s new stepsister, her summer looks to be a long string of lazy days on the Duval&#39;s lush beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Edison is hiding something. And the more Maris learns about him, the more she&#39;s given signs that she should stay as far away from him as possible. As wrong as it is, Maris is drawn to him. Around Edison, she feels truly alive and she&#39;s not willing to give that up. Even if it means a collision course with destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
