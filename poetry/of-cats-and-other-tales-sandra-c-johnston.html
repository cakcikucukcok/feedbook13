  <title>Of Cats and Other Tales - Sandra C. Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My intention as a healer is to begin a process for many people who have never understood the connection to our Mother Earth and all her creatures. I hope to open a doorway of understanding for those who seek the Oneness of all life.
My wish for you is that each poem, each prose piece, each story, carries medicine for you. Through art and self-expression each brings certain aspects of knowledge. These are lessons I personally learned from the animals, birds, insects, and human beings that crossed my path. These lessons are inclusive of my strengths and weaknesses, my talents and gifts, my vision and purpose, and my place in life.
In times of uncertainty, animals have been a source of comfort, a source of protection from fear, a reminder of centered knowingness and connection. To balance the energy of uncertainty, I meditated upon the experiences. As I entered the silence, my questions of self-mystery were answered as I wrote. In striving to be whole, I reflected upon the harmony as well as the discord of my many fragments.
Earths creatures are healing in that they soothe the spirit and empower the will. The truth needs no explanation just reflection.
May this book enrich the lives of all of you that it touches and may you feel my love as you journey along with me." />
