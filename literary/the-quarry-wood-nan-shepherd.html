  <title>The Quarry Wood - Nan Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Martha accepts a place at university, her decision is met with a mixture of hostility and pride by her uncomprehending family. This is the story of a young woman&#39;s journey to maturity and independence, struggling to cope with the intellectual and emotional challenges that surround her, at a time when such space was rarely given freely to women.  In The Quarry Wood, Nan Shepherd&#39;s subtle prose is matched by intense and memorable descriptions of the natural world, and a dry sense of humour. Ninety years after its first publication, it remains as fresh and original today." />
