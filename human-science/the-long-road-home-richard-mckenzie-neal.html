  <title>The Long Road Home... - Richard McKenzie Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By this point in our lives (my target readers) weve all heard the old adage You cant go home.  But what does it mean? 
As life winds down and the drone of existence begins to wane, I&#39;m feeling an intangible desire or need to reach back into my past and reconnect with a by-gone time and people...living and/or dead.  It feels like an elusive melody that seems distantly familiar, yet strange and unidentifiable.  
If all the above sounds like a premonition of the inevitable, I agree and accept that my time is ticking away.  But its not about dyingits about going home!  Im not afraid of dying, but I do struggle with the reality that I will no longer physically exist.  
I have to wonder if the term going home isnt a misnomer and maybejust maybe, were trying to return to Neverland (Fridays With Landon).  When we were very young we searched for that elusive, utopian communityand studies have shown that in our declining years, we slowly revert to our childhood.
Another line-of-thought is that its all just a mirage.  We know and accept that a man can be dying of thirst, in the middle of the driest desert, and his mind will anesthetize him by creating the illusion of an oasis.  If we can acknowledge that phenomenon (the minds coping mechanism) then it shouldnt be much of a stretch to reason that the elderly possess those same innate coping capabilitiesto ease their journey home.  Of course their mirage would be about going homenot to a place, but to another time.
What is the driver for this (apparently) universal pilgrimage? I have to wonder, even compare it to an addicts motivation (The Path to Addiction)one more trip down that path of pleasant memories even as the host is being sacrificed." />
