  <title>The Israel Letters - Nancy H. Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods love for His chosen nation Israel and desire for its people to draw closer to Him radiates throughout the pages of &lt;i&gt;The Israel Letters&lt;/i&gt;. The letters are penned to her beloved sibling, Israel, by a writer, the author names Grace. Those who love Israel and desire to pray for the nation will be greatly encouraged by the words of hope, faith, and trust found in each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written with love and endorsed by the great grace God shows toward Israel, the letters include insights of wisdom and joy, the signets of those who believe deeply in the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Israel Letters&lt;/i&gt; combines two of the most powerful tools in the world: prayer and the written word.  Its pages are filled with Scripture references and prayers to inspire intercession.  Israel is a Jewish state, but not all in Israel are people of faith.  Israelis are praying for their country, and so can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
Psalm 102:13
The Israel Bible &lt;br&gt;
Psalm 121:4, 8 (The Israel Bible)&lt;/p&gt;" />
