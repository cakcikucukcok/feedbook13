  <title>America and the Japanese Miracle - Aaron Forsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Aaron Forsberg presents an arresting account of Japan&#39;s postwar economic resurgence in a world polarized by the Cold War. His fresh interpretation highlights the many connections between Japan&#39;s economic revival and changes that occurred in the wider world during the 1950s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on a wealth of recently released American, British, and Japanese archival records, Forsberg demonstrates that American Cold War strategy and the U.S. commitment to liberal trade played a central role in promoting Japanese economic welfare and in forging the economic relationship between Japan and the United States. The price of economic opportunity and interdependence, however, was a strong undercurrent of mutual frustration, as patterns of conflict and compromise over trade, investment, and relations with China continued to characterize the postwar U.S.-Japanese relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forsberg&#39;s emphasis on the dynamic interaction of Cold War strategy, the business environment, and Japanese development challenges &quot;revisionist&quot; interpretations of Japan&#39;s success. In exploring the complex origins of the U.S.-led international economy that has outlasted the Cold War, Forsberg refutes the claim that the U.S. government sacrificed American commercial interests in favor of its military partnership with Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
