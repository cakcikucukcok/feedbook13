  <title>Pebbles - Julie Ann Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pebbles is a bracing stroll along the shore, where your discoveries unearth personal possibilities, where you look, think and wade in deeply, or just laugh at the breeze.
Through Pebbles, Author Julie Ann Smith brings together a wide-ranging selection of topics, delivered through a diversity of messages: practical, thought-provoking, humorous and even poetic.
As we tackle daily life, the stumbling blocks of Procrastination, Despair and even Communication itself can keep us on the same spiral, but you are offered ways to approach life through a selection of topics which help you find a clear path.  You are also invited to discover the meaning of The Riddle, be humoured by a snapshot of parents coping with three children in the Overly Practical guide to Parenting, and to give a thought to those whose memory is fading in Gradually Forgetting.
Selecting Pebbles from this shore could unlock your future, or just make you smile.  Dare to discover more about your options as well as the diversity of life, which we often take for granted." />
