  <title>Some Men Need Killing - Art Marsicano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A brilliant young man, Anthony Martino learned the ways of violence and Italian criminals early in life. Always deeply loving with friends and family and brutal with enemies, Martino hates his enemies with a white hot passion. In his part of the world, justice can be found only with a gun, knife, or a bomb.&lt;p&gt; 
When Martino is asked to give a presentation about organized crime to a college class in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, he is happy to accept. A former professor, Tony enjoys provoking thoughts and emotions in students. The same day he receives the professors request, he receives an e-mail message from a member of New York City&#39;s most powerful crime family requesting to see him. He also accepts this invitation.&lt;p&gt; 
When Ernie Valadi, Martinos nemesis from high school, taunts him and accuses him of being a con man, Martino challenges him to a fight. Will this fight be any different from their past entanglements? To what extent will Martino extract his revenge? A deeply religious man, will Martino be forgiven for his sins? Is he correct in his assumption that Some Men Need Killing?" />
