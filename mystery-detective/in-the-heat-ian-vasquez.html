  <title>In the Heat - Ian Vasquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boxer Miles Young thinks he&#39;s got one more shot in him before it&#39;s time to hang up the gloves for good. He may be the only one who thinks so. The truth is, he enjoys the recognition his career has brought him at home, in the small Latin American country of Belize, and he&#39;s worried about how he&#39;ll support his daughter once it&#39;s over. So when his promoter comes to him with a proposition that includes one last big fight, he listens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle Gilmore wants Miles to find her daughter, who&#39;s run off with some of her mother&#39;s money and her no-good boyfriend. Isabelle&#39;s afraid Rian&#39;s going to marry the kid, the only son of corrupt ex--police chief Marlon Tablada, and she wants Rian---and the money---found. In return, Miles gets put on a fight card with a $30,000 payday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s reluctant, but Isabelle thinks a hometown hero can get people to talk in ways a private investigator can&#39;t. Trouble is, before he can find Rian, he learns that there&#39;s much more to Isabelle, her daughter, and Marlon than Isabelle let on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly at home in the world of hardboiled crime writing, debut novelist Ian Vasquez is a bright new talent who infuses &lt;i&gt;In the Heat&lt;/i&gt; with a steamy, exotic voice all his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
