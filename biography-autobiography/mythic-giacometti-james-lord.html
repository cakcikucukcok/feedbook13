  <title>Mythic Giacometti - James Lord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (1901-66) was arguably the greatest sculptor of the twentieth century. He was also--as James Lord persuasively argued in &lt;i&gt;Giacometti: A Biography&lt;/i&gt;--a heroic figure whose vocation sustained him through a life of crippling anxiety and erotic guilt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost twenty years after it first appeared,&lt;i&gt; Giacometti&lt;/i&gt; has attained the status of a classic, one of the most candid and complete biographies of an artist in our time. In &lt;i&gt;Mythic Giacometti&lt;/i&gt;, Lord reveals the hidden &quot;blueprint&quot; of that work: a daringly literal, visionary interpretation of the myth of Oedipus as it affected the conduct and outcome of Giacometti&#39;s life. The result is a case study both in the development of an artist and in the writing of biography. Lord concentrates on the private totems of Giacometti&#39;s life-family legend, childhood memory, &lt;br&gt;illness and injury, crucial sexual encounters, intimations of mortality-that amounted, in Lord&#39;s view, to signs of a tragic destiny directly linked to the central tragedy of Western literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
