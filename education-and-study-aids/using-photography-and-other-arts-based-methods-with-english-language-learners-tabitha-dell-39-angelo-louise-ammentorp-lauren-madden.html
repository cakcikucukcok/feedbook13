  <title>Using Photography and Other Arts-Based Methods With English Language Learners - Tabitha Dell&#39;Angelo, Louise Ammentorp, Lauren Madden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book focuses on arts-based classroom practices that can be used to support English Language Learners. Recognizing that all children learn differently, but that the needs of children learning a new language are particularly unique, each chapter offers innovative in which arts-based methods can support learning across content areas. This book also recognizes the intersectionality of language and socio-economic status that exists for many ELLs. Framing knowledge of two languages as an asset for children who otherwise may come from low resource contexts is an important feature of these chapters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This edited book offers resources and practical suggestions from teachers who have successfully integrated the arts into their curriculum. It is a useful resource for classroom teachers and other practioners who work with ELL learners from K-12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
