  <title>Poetry 2Life - D.D. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry 2Life is a compilation of poems written while observing and overcoming different phases of life.  The poems were inspired by the pains faced while living and the spirit of determination to overcome them all. The poems were written from the perspective of different eyes: a child, a mother, a teacher, are just a few. This special collection of poetry is one that can be appreciated by all ages and hues.
  Each section of Poetry 2Life expresses the sentiments of three different phases of life:
       * Youth: Unlearned Innocence - a time where innocence leads to lessons learned.
       * Struggle: Pathway To Redemption - the experiences that can not be avoided by life yet give the stamina and wisdom to continue living
       * Love: Illuminated In The Dark -  the beauty and the pain of life&#39;s most significant  feeling.
  Poetry 2Life will be a reminder, that regardless of circumstances and locations, there is always a lesson to learn, a facet that can be appreciated after the storm.  Allow the poetry in these pages to touch, inspire and motivate." />
