  <title>Good Enough to Eat: A Collection of Poems for Children - Robert Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good Enough to Eat is an entertaining, educational tool for children, parents, and teachers alike. Longtime elementary school teacher Robert Atkinson uses his vast experience teaching English to share his love of poetry. There are several sections, each delineated by poetic form, ranging from haiku to limerick, couplet to sonnet.   At the beginning of each section, Robert defines the poetic form and makes it easy for a child to understand. Following the description are several funny and true-to-life poems penned by the author, accompanied by beautiful images that will engage even the youngest audience while imparting important writing techniques.   Teachers can use this collection in the classroom, and students can use it at home as they create their own pieces of literary artwork. Beyond the valuable educational aspect, though, Robert wrote each poem to entertain young ones and make the written word into a family affair. Ready, set ... get your pen and paper and go!" />
