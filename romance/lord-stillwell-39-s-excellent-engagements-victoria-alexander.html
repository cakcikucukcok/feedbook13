  <title>Lord Stillwell&#39;s Excellent Engagements - Victoria Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an enchanting novella from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Victoria Alexander, eligible viscount Winfield Elliott searches for a bride and discovers that love may be lovelier the second--or even third--time around.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow Me To Explain.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some say I do not take my engagements seriously.

She turned to writing full time and has never looked back. Victoria grew up traveling the country as an Air Force brat and is now settled in a very old house in Omaha, Nebraska, with her husband, two allegedly grown children and two bearded collies. She firmly believes housework is a four-letter word, there are no calories in anything eaten standing up, procrastination is an art form, and it&#39;s never too soon to panic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;30,000 Words" />
