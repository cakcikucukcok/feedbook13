  <title>Miami Attraction (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Kimani Hotties, Book 4) - Elaine Overton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;As Miami&#39;s most celebrated vet, Dusty Warren can have his pick of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; woman. But growing up on the road still makes him feel like an outsider in the city&#39;s elite circles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Mikayla Shroeder shows up at his ranch with her mangy mutt, and Dusty feels the white-hot spark of attraction. He knows Mikayla feels it, too, but the bestselling author is determined to stay aloof….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mikayla left her traumatic past behind to start over in a new town. She isn&#39;t prepared for the charismatic and compassionate animal doctor…or the untamed passion that takes them both by surprise. Animal attraction is one thing. But to allow this man into her heart as her protector, her lover, her soul mate? That&#39;s a wild sanctuary she never thought was possible–until now.&lt;/p&gt;
