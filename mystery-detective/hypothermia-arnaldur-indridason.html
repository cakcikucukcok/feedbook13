  <title>Hypothermia - Arnaldur Indridason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indridason fills the void that remains after you&#39;ve read Stieg Larsson&#39;s novels.&quot;- USA Today on &lt;i&gt;Hypothermia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Erlunder has spent his entire career struggling to evade the ghosts of his past.  But ghosts are visiting him, both in the form of a séance attended by a dead woman and also in the reemerging puzzle of two young people who went missing 30 years ago. And there&#39;s the ghost of the detective&#39;s disastrous marriage, which, despite the pleas of his drug-addled daughter, he is unwilling to confront. In addition, he&#39;s still obsessed with the disappearance of his brother, who vanished without a trace when they were boys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can only run from his ghosts for so long, and, when they finally catch up with him, Erlunder is forced to face the heart shattering truth of his past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most haunting crime novels readers are likely to encounter this year or any other, this mystery set in Iceland belongs on the shelf of every serious reader of suspense fiction. &lt;i&gt;Hypothermia &lt;/i&gt;will chill you to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
