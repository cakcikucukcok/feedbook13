        &lt;p&gt;An illicit encounter with the Spaniard…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Heiress Elin Saunderson was instantly seduced by mysterious stranger Cortez. But after their sinful night together she was left alone…and pregnant! A year later, she learns that Cortez is the rightful successor to her adopted father’s fortune and penniless Elin finds herself at risk of losing everything – including her son!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cortez Ramos is set on claiming the secret Elin kept from him – but Elin proves as protective a mother as she is a tortuous temptation. His solution: demand a marriage of convenience which will legitimise his heir and return Elin to his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
