  <title>Transition 114: Transition: The Magazine of Africa and the Diaspora - Iu Press Journals</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Published three times per year by Indiana University Press for the Hutchins Center at Harvard University, Transition is a unique forum for the freshest, most compelling ideas from and about the black world. Since its founding in Uganda in 1961, the magazine has kept apace of the rapid transformation of the African Diaspora and has remained a leading forum of intellectual debate. This issue of Transition-&quot;Gay Nigeria&quot;-pays tribute to those who &quot;agitate the establishment.&quot; Gay Nigeria grapples with anti-gay sentiment in Africa through the case-in-point of Nigeria&#39;s recent Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, and the global backlash against it. Ayo Sogunro, Rudolf Pell Gaudio, and Davis Mac-Iyalla introduce readers to the complexities of being queer in Nigeria. The editors also remember Amiri Baraka (1934-2014), championed by Molefi Kete Asante as &quot;a righteous defender of human freedom.&quot; Komozi Woodard, Ishmael Reed, and Baraka&#39;s daughter Kellie Jones add their recollections of the controversial poet-activist. The issue is further graced by tales quintessentially diasporic: a Ghanaian slave-fort turned five-star resort by a British ex-pat; a West African merchant-missionary returning former slaves to his Gold Coast homeland; and tips on how to freak out your American roommate. With incarceration rates of black Americans continuing to soar, Micol Seigel wants to know who makes bank in the lucrative world of bail. Also, is American cinema ready for a black woman protagonist? And finally, enjoy an interview with director Steve McQueen.&lt;/P&gt;" />
