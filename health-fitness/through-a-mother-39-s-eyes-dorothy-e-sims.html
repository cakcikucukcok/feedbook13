  <title>Through a Mother&#39;s Eyes: - Dorothy E. Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;...I believe this information will help many parents be prepared for the unknown, and assist in letting them know that their experiences are not unique. In Through A Mothers Eyes: The Ups and Downs of a Cure, essential information on the process, not just the detailed medical information, will help to guide many parents through an unthinkable journey. Throughout the 14 chapters, Dorothy provides candid descriptions of the challenges she faced when her young daughter was diagnosed with leukemia and suffered a subsequent relapse, the toxicities of the treatments, the difficulties of navigating the health care system, and real life problems intruding through (including a house fire and threats of losing ones job)...All of these shared experiences are invaluable for those who will be exposed to these similar situations.&quot;

According to Childrens Hospital of Philadelphias 2013 Childhood Cancer Awareness Infographic: Every year 11,600 children under the age of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer. Every year 1,310 kids will die from their disease. Each year about 4% of government funding on cancer research is spent on childhood cancer. 
A portion of the proceeds from the book sale is going towards cancer research at CHOP." />
