  <title>The Taking of Libbie, SD - David Housewright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In David Housewright&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Taking of Libbie, SD&lt;/i&gt;, a grifter cons an entire town using Mac McKenzie&#39;s name, leaving the real McKenzie facing an angry town with nothing left to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rushmore McKenzie is a retired cop, an unexpected millionaire, and an occasional unlicensed private investigator. So, it isn&#39;t the biggest surprise in the world when he&#39;s attacked and kidnapped from his home--McKenzie has more than a few enemies out there with a grudge against him. But it is a surprise when it turns out his kidnapping is a case of mistaken identity. &lt;br&gt;McKenzie was taken to the small plains town of Libbie, South Dakota which just lost pretty much everything it had to a con man using McKenzie&#39;s name. Using a scam involving a new shopping mall, the grifter apparently stole all the money electronically from the bank then disappeared, leaving behind a devastated town full of people with many reasons to hate him. To that list of enemies, he&#39;s just added McKenzie who is now determined to help the devastated townspeople, as well as catch and punish the weasel besmirching his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
