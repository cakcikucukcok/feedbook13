  <title>Undeniable Connections - Linda Beggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In August of 1958, after a refreshing swim in Lake Michigan, a young couple suffering from infertility issues received the call that would change their lives forever. As the happy couple drove from Michigan to Marion, Indiana, to pick up their daughter, the babys birth mother sobbed as she shakily signed the adoption papers. Although her daughter had already left her body, she never left her heartsealing a connection that would endure until her last breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Beggs shares a compelling story of raw feelings and an undeniable bond as she details how she searched for familiarity and yearned for connections throughout her life after she was adopted at birth. Despite growing up in a Christian home with loving parents, Beggs describes how she confronted abandonment and identity issues, along with an increasing curiosity about her biological mother. After two attempts to find her birth mother failed, Beggs buried her feelingsuntil her persistence finally led her to meet her biological mother, acknowledge her emotions, and receive insight and healing through Gods grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeniable Connections reveals one womans journey through adoption as she comes to terms with her emotions and, through Gods wonderful plan, finds beauty in the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
