  <title>Embrace the Suck - Stephen Madden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TO BE FIT, OR CROSSFIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifelong amateur athlete Stephen Madden immersed himself in the culture, diet, and psyche of CrossFit&amp;#8212;the fast-growing but controversial fitness regime that&amp;#8217;s a stripped-down combination of high-intensity aerobic activity, weightlifting, calisthenics, and gymnastics. Madden is just one of more than two million athletes worldwide to do so.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Embrace the Suck&lt;/em&gt;, the former editor in chief of &lt;em&gt;Bicycling&lt;/em&gt; magazine explores with irreverence, humor, and soul-touching candor the fitness revolution sweeping America. Madden chronicles the year he devoted to trying to master all the basic CrossFit exercises, like double unders, muscle-ups, and kipping pull-ups, and immersing himself in the Paleo diet that strips weight from its followers but leaves them fantasizing about loaves of bread. Along the way, he explores the culture of the sport, his experience of becoming a CrossFit coach, and some basic questions about himself, his past, and his athletic limitations&amp;#8212;and why something so difficult and punishing can be at once beautiful, funny, and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a CrossFitter or a nascent athlete, you will come away from this book understanding the limitless potential of the human body and mind, and will learn what it takes to welcome and defeat any kind of suck.&lt;/p&gt;" />
