  <title>My Gifts of Love - Yvonne Helland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would first of all like to say my book is all about love its basically about friendship and also about meeting someone special and getting to know one another and yes falling deeply in love. There is really nothing like it. Falling in love to me is the ultimate. To me it helps to bring joy and peace and love and happiness into your life. It helps to make life a whole lot sweeter. It puts a smile on your face and it gives you that warm and caring feeling you get when you know within your heart that someone cares deeply about you. I would love to see this book touch so many hearts and so many lives and to bring people closer together with one- another. For couples to meet and fall in love this is my wish for all of you that read my book that ultimately along the way you will all find a happy ending. There is nothing like a happy endings thats a big part of what life is all about is finding that special someone and having that happy ending.
I also want to thank all the people at the publishing company that helped to make my dream of writing this book come true. I want to thank first of all my best friend Mini for helping to make it possible for me to get this book published. I also want to thank Mary Flores, Faith Go, Rey Santos also everyone in the Production Department that helped and worked so hard at putting my book together and getting it published. Thanks to all of you for your hard work and patience with me. I have one last thing to say. Remember everyone when you meet someone and you fall in love and you touch one anothers hearts always respect one another and always strive to have those happy endings.
Love to all of you
Y.H." />
