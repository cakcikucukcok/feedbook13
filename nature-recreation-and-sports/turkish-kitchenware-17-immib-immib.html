  <title>Turkish Kitchenware 17 - Immib Immib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We greet you once again with an Ambiente Fair special issue. In 2015 IMMIB (Istanbul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minerals and Metals Exporter&amp;rsquo;s Associations) takes the scene at the 67th instance of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;annual Ambiente fair, in which Turkey has participated on a national scale for the 20th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;time, in halls 3.0, 5.0, and 10.1, and with 67 firms. As you know, the Ambiente fair is the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;prestigious far for firms operating in the house and kitchen wares, and souvenir sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from individual participants, Turkish firms which offer a wide product range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;including metal kitchenware, small electrical appliances, plastic kitchen and house&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;wares, glass items, yard furniture and gift items draw the attention of purchasers with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;their competitive prices and superior quality products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would like to impart a few brief information points regarding the fairs in which we&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;had participated before. 46 Turkish firms in total attended the Paris Packaging Fair,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;held in Paris with the participation of 1500 firms and 500 brands worldwide. Over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 percent of the fair&amp;rsquo;s participants come from outside France, and the fair receives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;over 100 thousand visitors from 100 countries. We also took our place at the Zuchex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia Fair held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in which the Turkish national organization was&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;implemented for the first time by IMMIB. We have implemented out seventh overseas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;marketing event for Toronto-Montreal, Canada, that had been determined as a target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;market within the strategy formed for the Turkish House and Kitchen Ware Sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseas Marketing Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To return to the contents of the magazine you are holding in your hand, we can say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;delightful pages are waiting for you to read them. In our Brand History page, we&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;were guests of Asel, which emphasizes the essential nature of quality, aesthetics,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and durability in their designs. We interviewed company owner Bilal Demiro&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;lu,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;who related they had entered the appliances market with round ovens, and added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;electric stoves, heaters, and grills and that they aimed for overseas markets since the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;beginning. Other companies we interviewed were G&amp;ouml;rgel, O.M.S., Silver, &lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;ensoy-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seden, Mertgift, Freecook, Lav, and Du?nya Plastik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our Regional page we took a look at glass working, which is an art that was blended&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;with the cultural heritage of Anatolia. Glass objects that had been crafted in the first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;workshops established in the 17th century in Pa&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;abah&amp;ccedil;e, Istanbul with the value and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;significance assigned to art by the Ottoman Empire are displayed in museums today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developing of the technique of blowing is indicated as the most significant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;advance in the art of glass making. How would you like to take a closer look at this art?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also met with our successful designers. Aysun Alt&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;nda&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;, Emre Ak&amp;ccedil;al, Sevil Acar, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ba&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;ak Ergin were guests of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have featured the culinary journey and delicious recipes of Arif Kemal Do&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;an,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive Chef of the Pera Palace Hotel Jumeirah Agatha Restaurant.
