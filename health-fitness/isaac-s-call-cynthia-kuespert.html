  <title>Isaac’S Call - Cynthia Kuespert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story opens on a summer day in Annapolis when 39 year-old ISAAC DOUGLAS, a talented African American attorney and young father, is suddenly faced with two life-changing decisions.  To replace his running mate who was mysteriously murdered, The Governor of Maryland asked Isaac to run for Lieutenant Governor.  On the same day Isaac received a rambling letter from CAPN JIM, the scion of the wealthy Chestertown, Maryland WORTHINGTON family.  Capn Jim is now serving a 25-year sentence for shooting a black boy who was playing on his dock near the family mansion on the Chester River.  Capn Jim begs Isaac to help him get out of prison.  Youre a big deal lawyer now, know the Governor, know the ropes.
For five generations, Isaacs family has served the wealthy Worthingtons. Most recently, Capn Jims wife, the kindly MARION WORTHINGTON, funded Isaacs education.  Until recently African-Americans have had little or no power.  They have survived rapes, lynchings and constant humiliations of racism.  Isaacs ancestors were bought, sold, and whipped.  His great-grandfather was lynched.  Blacks were not allowed to vote or testify against whites, but now Isaac has the promise of new power and a dilemma.  Reluctantly, Isaac visits Capn Jim in prison. He learns that perhaps Capn Jim just fired a warning shot from his veranda.  Maybe the boy was pushed off the dock and drowned.
By chance, Isaac meets DILLY PRICE, a rough black mechanic, who reveals he was foreman of the jury and convinced his fellow jurors to convict Capn Jim. About time we turned the tablesour chance to get one athem.   Shocked, Isaac heads for the Chestertown courthouse, where he reads the complete transcript of Capn Jims trial.  Tormented by feelings of obligation Isaac wonders if he can overcome his own long buried rage and resentment?  What should he do?  Its Isaacs call." />
