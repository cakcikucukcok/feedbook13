  <title>Saigon Kids - Les Arbuckle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Looking for unusual coming of age books? Follow the coming of age adventures of a U.S. military brat during the early Vietnam war years in Saigon&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The early Vietnam war years through the eyes of a U.S. military brat:&lt;/b&gt; In May of 1962, Naval Chief Petty Officer Bryant Arbuckle flew to Saigon to establish a new Armed Forces radio station. Next to follow were his wife and three boys, Leslie among them. &lt;i&gt;Saigon Kids&lt;/i&gt; is the candid, recondite slice of fourteen-year-old military brat Les Arbuckle’s experience at the American Community School (ACS) during the critical months of the Vietnam War when events would, quite literally, ignite in downtown Saigon. In 1963, Saigon was beautiful, violent, and dirty – and the most exciting place a fourteen-year-old American boy could live.  Saigon offered a rich array of activities, and much to the consternation of their parents and teachers, Les and his fellow military brats explored the dangers with reckless abandon  running from machine gun fire, watching a Buddhist monk burn to death, visiting brothels late at night or, trading currency on the black market
&lt;b&gt;Coming of age in the streets of Vietnam War torn Saigon:&lt;/b&gt; When Les first arrives in Vietnam, he is a stranger in a strange land, expecting boredom in a country he doesn’t know. But the American social scene is more vibrant than he expected. The American Community School is a blend of kids from all over the globe who arrived in Saigon as the fuse on Saigon was about to ignite. As the ACS students continue their American lifestyle behind barbed wire, Saigon unravels in chaos and destruction. In spite of this ugliness – an ever-present feature of everyday life -- Les tells his story of teenage angst with humor and precocity. 
&lt;b&gt;Coming of age tale with a twist:&lt;/b&gt;The events leading up to the Vietnam War provide an unusual backdrop for this coming-of-age tale with a twist.  &lt;i&gt;Saigon Kids&lt;/i&gt;  will also make a perfect companion to the documentary film (sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts) currently in production. The film chronicles the lives of “military brats” living in Saigon in the volatile years from 1958 to 1964." />
