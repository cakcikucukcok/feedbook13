  <title>Just Meditating - Mary W. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just Meditating was titled by Mary W. Johnsons husband, Bernie. This was the first book of poetry written in 1999, but this is the last of the three to be published. It presents an inspiring collection of heartfelt poetry. Mary was given Gods gift of poetry at age eighty. Between the ages of eighty and ninety, she wrote three books, covering them lovingly with wallpaper so she could give them freely to everyone. In Him was the last one written, but it was the first to be published in Marys memory by her children in 2012. Praising Him was published in 2013. Just Meditating has now been published, the third in consecutive years, to complete the trilogy in time for what would have been her hundredth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marys poetry shared her personal relationship with her Savior. Some poems simply gave praise to the Lord. Many poems spoke of Jesuss cruel death on the cross. She spoke of looking forward to heaven and of being sure you are going there. She gave glory to God, who created man and our miraculous bodies. She examined prophecies regarding the end times, always pointing to the Bible and Jesuss example for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her lifetime of Bible study and love of the scripture was evident in her poetry. Through this knowledge, she referenced her poetry to the passage that inspired it. Marys faith and dedication to her Savior was demonstrated through her life of service and giving to others. Her life was an inspiration to her family, her numerous church friends, and her community. Her family was blessed to be able to share their mothers gift of poetry with you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
