  <title>Passion of Youth - Wilhelm Reich, Philip Schmitz, Mary Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When he died in 1957, Wilhelm Reich had been the most revolutionary figure in psychoanalysis and the only student of Freud&#39;s to carry his libido theory into experimental science.  Reich&#39;s legacy includes such essential volumes as &lt;i&gt;Character Analysis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Function of the Orgasm, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Mass Psychology of Fascism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Passion of Youth&lt;/i&gt; is the latest of Reich&#39;s writings to appear posthumously, and it reveals that Reich&#39;s life, no less than his work, was provocative and instructive.&lt;br&gt;In a reminiscence composed in 1919, &quot;Childhood and Puberty,&quot; Reich tells of his earliest years, spent on a country estate in Bukovina.  He describes his first conscious experiences of sexuality, and the further development of his sexual life; his schooling; and, above all, the catastrophic infidelity that led first to his mother&#39;s suicide in 1910 and then to his father&#39;s death in 1914.&lt;br&gt;With the outbreak of the Great War, Reich fled Bukovina and enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he became a battalion commander.  In an excerpt from his 1937 &lt;i&gt;History of Sexpol&lt;/i&gt;, he recounts how his four years in the military impressed on him the masses&#39; numb obedience to authority and the automatic quality of a ceaselessly operating &quot;war machine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Reich began his study of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1919 and graduated in the summer of 1922.  His diaries from these years record his encounter with Freud; the growth of his conviction that sexuality is the core around which all social life, and the inner life, revolves; his first political stirrings; and his analysis of the woman who would become his first wife.  These diaries abound in turbulent emotions and the passion of youth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
