A road that travels in the exact opposite direction of the alternative that could have been a wasted life of crime and misdeeds leading to obscurity. Accomplishing GREATNESS requires accomplishing 100% of what you are capable of rather settling for the 40% that almost all of us allow to define our lives" />
