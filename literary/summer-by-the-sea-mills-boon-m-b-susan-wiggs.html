  <title>Summer By The Sea (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Susan Wiggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;With a little determination and a lot of charm, Rosa Capoletti took a run-down pizza joint and turned it into an award-winning restaurant that has been voted &quot;best place to propose&quot; three years in a row. For Rosa, though, there has been no real romance since her love affair with Alexander Montgomery ended without explanation a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But guess who&#39;s just come back to town?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reunited at the beach house where they first fell in love, Rosa and Alexander discover that the secrets of the past are not what they seem. Now, with all that she wants right in front of her, Rosa searches for happiness with the man who once broke her heart and learns that in love, as in life, there are second chances.&lt;/p&gt;
