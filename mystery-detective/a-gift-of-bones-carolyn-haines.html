  <title>A Gift of Bones - Carolyn Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christmas comes to Zinnia, Mississippi--Sarah Booth Delaney must solve a case as the holiday approaches, in this new cozy mystery from Carolyn Haines.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christmas is just around the corner and Sarah Booth and Tinkie are preparing for a festive holiday season. After a turbulent season of solving cases, they&#39;re ready for some holiday cheer. Sarah Booth and Sheriff Coleman Peters have finally gotten together, and this is the first holiday they&#39;re celebrating as a couple. Sarah Booth busies herself with decking the halls and daydreaming about romantic Christmas nights with Coleman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then her friend Cece Dee Falcon shows up needing Sarah Booth&#39;s help--right now. She shows Sarah Booth a box that was delivered by courier and left at Cece&#39;s front porch. It contains a lock of hair, a photograph of a pretty young woman, very pregnant, and a note demanding ransom for the return of the teen. Cece reveals that this is her cousin&#39;s daughter, Eve Falcon, and that she&#39;d lost touch with this part of her family years ago. Eve and Cece had been close, until the family had a terrible falling out, and banished Cece from their lives. The countdown begins as the kidnapper pushes for payment--or else, he threatens, Eve will meet her maker. It&#39;s up to Sarah Booth and her friends to find the girl before something terrible happens on what should be the merriest day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Haines&#39;s trademark humor and lovable characters are back, in a heartwarming Christmas story that will enchant and delight readers looking for a suspenseful mystery wrapped in joyful holiday merriment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
