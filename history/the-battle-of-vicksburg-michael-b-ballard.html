  <title>The Battle of Vicksburg - Michael B. Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Vicksburg campaign was among the longest of the Civil War, lasting from 26 May 1862 to 4 July 1863. This Civil War Short provides a compelling narrative of the final six weeks of the campaign, excerpted from Michael Ballard&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Vicksburg: The Campaign That Opened the Mississippi&lt;/i&gt;, which blends strategy and tactics with the human element, reminding us that while Gettysburg has become the focal point of the history and memory of the Civil War, the outcome at Vicksburg was met with as much celebration and relief in the North as the Gettysburg victory, and it should be viewed as equally important today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNC Press Civil War Shorts excerpt rousing narratives from distinguished books published by the University of North Carolina Press on the military, political, social, and cultural history of the Civil War era. Produced exclusively in ebook format, they focus on pivotal moments and figures and are intended to provide a concise introduction, stir the imagination, and encourage further exploration of the topic.
