  <title>Umbrella Summer - Lisa Graff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Annie Richards knows there are a million things to look out for&amp;#8212;bicycle accidents, food poisoning, chicken pox, smallpox, typhoid fever, runaway zoo animals, and poison oak. That&#39;s why being careful is so important, even if it does mean giving up some of her favorite things, like bike races with her best friend, Rebecca, and hot dogs on the Fourth of July. Everyone keeps telling Annie not to worry so much, that she&#39;s just fine. But they thought her brother, Jared, was just fine too, and Jared died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a new neighbor, who looks as plain as a box of toothpicks but has some surprising secrets of her own, to make Annie realize that her plans for being careful aren&#39;t working out as well as she had hoped. And with a lot of help from those around her&amp;#8212;and a book about a pig, too&amp;#8212;Annie just may find a way to close her umbrella of sadness and step back into the sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With winsome humor and a dash of small-town charm, Lisa Graff&#39;s third novel is a touching look at rising above grief and the healing power of community. &lt;/p&gt;" />
