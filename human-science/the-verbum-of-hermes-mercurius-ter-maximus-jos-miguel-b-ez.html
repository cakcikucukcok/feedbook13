  <title>The Verbum of Hermes (Mercurius Ter Maximus) - José Miguel Báez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Words from the Author&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am Jos Miguel Bez, the esoteric and hermetic philosopher of the books, The Theosophy of Twt-Mos Djoser, The Book of Djehuti, La Filosofa Del Libro De Hermes Mercurio Trismegisto, and finally my last work, The Verbum of Hermes Mercurius Ter Maximus for those who are brave enough to read, analyze, critic and learn the mysteries of ancient religions, philosophy, science, astronomy (astrology), chemistry (alchemy) and Theurgy of the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians and Chaldeans to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am the spiritual and psychical Hermes Mercurius Ter Maximus since I was able to enchant the heavens, speak with the birds of the sky, the animals of the oceans, the beasts of the fields and have communion with the gods and goddesses and observe their formless form behind all forms and become the man inside of the universal form of the highest G-d, a divine and cosmic androgyny.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The true Book of Thoth is not physical and in your earthly dimensional confinement but it must be searched and found beyond the confinement of your earthly world and dimensional reality of your space-time and when you have vanquished your fears, egos and stop demonizing others more advance than you then, you will find such a book whose wisdom and understanding will open your mind and heart that you may decide to embrace G-d or be defeated by your own impurities and iniquities for only he and she who have a pure heart and spirit in essence may become one with the Absolute All.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Do try your best to live a life in harmony with one another, with all life forms, with Nature and the Earth and the divine and cosmic laws since this is my last reincarnation and I will never again return to you to teach you the hidden, concealed and unrevealed wisdom contain in the primordial ocean of divine mind and spirit.
I am the sacred and anointed Magi of the divine androgyny, which exists also as an infinite potential and creating force that permeates, sustains, nourishes and contains all things." />
