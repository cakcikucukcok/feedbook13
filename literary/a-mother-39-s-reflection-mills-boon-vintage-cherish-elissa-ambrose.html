  <title>A Mother&#39;s Reflection (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Elissa Ambrose</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;A WOMAN&#39;S LOVE… A MOTHER&#39;S SECRET&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel Hartwell, just a kid when she gave up her daughter for adoption, now yearned to be part of Megan&#39;s life and fulfill her motherly role. But a run-in with Adam Wessler, Megan&#39;s smoldering–and single–adoptive father made her realize that her maternal instincts were not the only ones going unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adam couldn&#39;t have known what Rachel&#39;s real connection to his daughter was, because, clearly, all he wanted to do was pull her close–from the moment he laid eyes on her. But what would happen when he learned the truth about their relationship? Would she be welcomed into the fold? Or on the outside looking in…again?&lt;/p&gt;
