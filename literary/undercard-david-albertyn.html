      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set over the course of twenty-four exhilarating hours, &lt;em&gt;Undercard&lt;/em&gt; is the story of four childhood friends, now in their early thirties, unexpectedly reunited by a high-profile prizefight in a Las Vegas casino . . . and an even higher-profile murder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Tyron Shaw returns to his hometown of Las Vegas after eleven years in the Marines, he&amp;#8217;s surprised to discover that two of his best friends from childhood are all anyone is talking about: Antoine Deco, three years out of prison, hasn&amp;#8217;t lost a boxing match since his release, and tonight is fighting in the undercard to the fight of the decade; and Keenan Quinn, a police officer who killed an unarmed teenager and escaped punishment from the courts, is the subject of a protest tomorrow morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tyron has trouble reconciling either story with his memory of these men, and the situation escalates when he runs into the love of his life, Naomi Wilks, a retired WNBA player, basketball coach, and estranged wife of Keenan. As Tyron reconnects with his old community, he will learn over the next twenty-four hours that much has changed since he left Las Vegas . . . and there is much more that he never understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reef, an aquarium-themed casino and the hottest resort on the Strip, is the backdrop for this bullet-paced narrative, where loyalty to one&amp;#8217;s friends, one&amp;#8217;s family, and one&amp;#8217;s community are ever at odds, and every choice has deadly repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
