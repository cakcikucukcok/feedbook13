  <title>Places in God - Beryle E. Whitten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine being inside of God&#39;s ear and hearing all the prayers, all the languages spoken in the world. Imagine walking on shiny red embroidery threads that are the heart strings of God. At one point, you must drive a six wheeled bus to move from one area to another. You are transported by thought, led by a Phoenix and instructed by the Major Angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an allegorical journey that will find a permanent home in your heart and in your library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Places in God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a delicate adventure that transposes a manner of wisdom into learning entertainment. It leads the reader on an allegorical journey through the inside of God&#39;s body. Five students follow the Major Angel, God&#39;s tour guide, into His ears and through His heart with stopovers in His attitudes and freedoms. They went to a boutique, a theater and sat in a boardroom. With excitement and awe they were absorbed. With breathtaking silent transports to and through phenomenal inner parts, they were literally digested and released. There is a spiritual increase that becomes apparent as you are propelled with them through Places in God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
