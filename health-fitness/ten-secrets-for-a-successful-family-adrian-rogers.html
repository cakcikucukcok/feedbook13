  <title>Ten Secrets for a Successful Family - Adrian Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you want your family to be vital and victorious? To be successful in the ways that count? To have a home where your children learn to love God, love others, and turn that love into a living testimony for Christ?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As much as you want this, God wants it even more. So much so that He gave parents a blueprint for building a spiritually successful family: the Ten Commandments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our generation has come to view them as being more or less like black-and-white television: revolutionary &quot;back then&quot;; sorely outdated now. But pastor Adrian Rogers opens up the wonder of the Ten Commandments in a whole new way and encourages you to look at them again. When you do, you&#39;ll discover for yourself that they are not obsolete, as so many think, but absolute&amp;mdash;and absolutely essential for your family today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book not only shows you how to teach these ten &quot;liberating laws of life&quot; consistently, creatively, convincingly, and compellingly, but lays out why it is so important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want your family to thrive? Take these godly principles to heart&amp;mdash;help write them on your children&#39;s hearts&amp;mdash;and watch as God passes His blessing on to those youngsters you cherish so much.&lt;/p&gt;" />
