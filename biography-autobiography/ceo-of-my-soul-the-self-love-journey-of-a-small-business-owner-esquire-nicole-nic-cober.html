  <title>CEO Of My Soul: The Self-Love Journey of a Small Business Owner - Esquire Nicole &quot;Nic&quot; Cober</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Small business consultant Nicole &amp;quot;Nic&amp;quot; Cober,&amp;nbsp;Esq.&amp;nbsp;knows the sobering statistic: Nearly 80% of ALL&amp;nbsp;small businesses fail. She knows it because she&amp;#39;s lived it. This is her story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She built her first business, Soul...Day Spa and Salon, to be a community staple in the DC metro area, with a flawless local reputation and national media acclaim. She felt like she had it all: a successful business, a beautiful family, a dream house...and a Benz to boot! But, after nearly ten years, her personal and&amp;nbsp;professional lives collided and crumbled. She was forced to close her businesses, file bankruptcy,&amp;nbsp;confront both divorce(s) and eviction notices, all while raising her two sons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Through it all, Nic kept her head held high, and she came back from defeat stronger than ever. Losing Soul, the business, was a catalyst to reconnecting with her own soul through self-love and her faith. Now, she wants to share what she has learned with&amp;nbsp;unflinching honesty,&amp;nbsp;sister-wit and vulnerability to help her fellow &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; sisters and small business owners achieve their dreams and avoid some of her pitfalls without sacrificing love, family, or happiness.&lt;br /&gt; In CEO of My SOUL, Nic shares the perfect blend of valuable business advice woven together with true accounts of relationship struggles, family triumphs, and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book is a practical and personal how-to guide for entrepreneurs, but it&amp;#39;s also much more than that. It&amp;#39;s an invitation to join Nic on a&amp;nbsp;personal journey: a spiritual quest for self-love and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
