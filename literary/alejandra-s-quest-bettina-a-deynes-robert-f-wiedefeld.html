  <title>Alejandra’S Quest - Bettina A. Deynes, Robert F. Wiedefeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Alejandra German first immigrates to America, she has great hope that her new life will be much better than the one she left behind in Uruguay. But as the years pass, Alejandra discovers that her challenges have followed her. Now the mother of two sons and stuck in an unfulfilling marriage and a disheartening career, Alejandra can only hope that the dreams she once nurtured have not been shattered by her circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a workaholic husband who barely knows she is alive and with professional success seemingly just beyond her reach, Alejandra reluctantly agrees to sacrifice her personal time to meet her business partner, Terry Longbow, and his son in Memphis for an impromptu meeting about a company for sale. It is not long before Alejandra and Terry purchase the small business without any idea that their lives are about to collide with a global economic meltdown. Now in a struggle for survival, a vulnerable Alejandra is led into the arms of another man who shows her that happiness may not be out of her reach after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alejandras Quest&lt;/em&gt; is the compelling tale of a woman trapped between two lives as she embarks on a relentless quest to make her dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;" />
