  <title>Poodle Mistress - Sandi Latimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was 1973 when Sandi met handsome pilot Red Latimer and was amazed to discover he was raising two toy poodles. As the two began a courtship, it was not long before Sandi not only fell in love with Red, but also his dogs. Sandi and Red soon married and for the next twenty-seven years, they opened their hearts, home, and lives to nine toy poodles. This is their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In her memoir &lt;i&gt;Poodle Mistress&lt;/i&gt;, Sandi shares a tender narrative that transports others through her lifelong journey as she and Red loved, cared for, and grieved for their cherished dogs who captured their hearts with their insatiable thirst for adventure, naturally protective nature, and human-like personalities. From studly Jacques to lovable Shane to big-footed Zeke, Sandi details how the dogs quickly adapted to change and entertained daily with their unforgettable antics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Poodle Mistress&lt;/i&gt; is a story of unconditional love, devotion, and how nine dogs forever changed the lives of a husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love from a pet is pure and unfailing. Sandras book shows us how being loved by small creatures can mysteriously teach tall humans to love just the same.&lt;br&gt;
