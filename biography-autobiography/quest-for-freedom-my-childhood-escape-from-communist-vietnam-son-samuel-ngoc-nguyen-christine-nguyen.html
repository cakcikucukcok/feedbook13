      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Your story provides insight and shows how fortitude can be much stronger than courage and proves that if you stay true to your beliefs you can overcome. The Quest for Freedom is a powerful story of survival and triumph. Thanks for sharing it with me! - Bryan Penn, Principal Blessed Sacrament Catholic School  &quot;This true story exemplifies and honors the determination Son had as both a young boy, and then as a teenager. He navigates a world no child should ever have to know. He tells his story from the perspectives that made sense to a mind that remained bright despite physical and emotional starvation growing up in Vietnam.&quot; - Tita Smith, psychologist  &quot;I read quite fast but with this book I had to read every word and savor the story.  It is full of life lessons many of us forget and take for granted.&quot; - Lina Smith, Director of Refugee Services &amp; Immigration Refugee &amp; Immigrant Center Asian Association of Utah" />
