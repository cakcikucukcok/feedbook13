  <title>Tides and the Ocean - William Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Surfers, sailors, and anyone who loves the ocean will enjoy this visual exploration of the world&#39;s seas along its shores, including rip tides, swells, waves, and tsunamis. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;div&gt;Tide is the vertical motion of water, something so subtle it is impossible to see with the naked eye. Inspired by his travels around the world&#39;s coastline in a camper van with his young family, William Thomson captures the cycles of the sea&#39;s movement, and intersperses his adventures surfing the waves and charting the tides. Throughout &lt;i&gt;Tides and the Ocean &lt;/i&gt;are his graphic renderings of unusual tidal maps, as well as other forms of water movement, including rip, rapids, swell, stream, tide, wave, whirlpool, and tsunami.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tides and the Ocean &lt;/i&gt;explains how the tides surge when the moon and sun align with the earth; how ocean streams alternate direction every six hours (which is invaluable information for kayakers, paddle boarders, and fishermen); why skyscraper-sized tsunamis occur frequently in an Alaskan Bay; and the most deadly beach orientation for rip currents. Also emphasized throughout is the importance of keeping the world&#39;s oceans healthy and full of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;Published in time for beach travel, this large-format hardcover is ideal for anyone who knows and loves the sea, and who wants to understand, discover, surf, or sail it better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
