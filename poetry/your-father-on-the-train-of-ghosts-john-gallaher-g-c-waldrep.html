  <title>Your Father on the Train of Ghosts - John  Gallaher, G.C. Waldrep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Your Father on the Train of Ghosts&lt;/I&gt; is one of the most extensive collaborations in American poetry. Over the course of a year, acclaimed poets G.C. Waldrep and John Gallaher wrote poems back and forth, sometimes once or twice a week, sometimes five or six a day. As the collaboration deepened, a third &quot;voice&quot; emerged that neither poet can claim as solely their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poems of &lt;I&gt;Your Father on the Train of Ghosts&lt;/I&gt; read as lyric snapshots of a culture we are all too familiar with, even as it slips from us: malls and supermarkets, museums and parades, toxic waste and cheesecakes, ghosts and fire, fathers and sons. Ultimately, these fables and confessions constitute a sort of gentle apocalypse, a user-friendly self-help manual for the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;G.C.
