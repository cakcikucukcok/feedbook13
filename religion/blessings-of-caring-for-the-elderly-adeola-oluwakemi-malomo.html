  <title>Blessings of Caring for the Elderly - Adeola Oluwakemi Malomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is really an elder? The Elder is the one that is older than the oldest. The Elder is the one that is called Ancient of Days. The Elder is the one that has been before the word elder was known. The Elder has been before the world was formed. The Creator that no one created is the Elder that has an answer to it all. 
As we listen to our elderly ones and yield to their godly counsel and advice, our time of training in the school of hard knocks is significantly reduced. But the fact is, there are some elders that you dont want to ever be in contact with throughout your life on earth. This is the reason you need to know who the elders you must care for are in order for you not to live a life without a guide. 
When you take care of the elderly, it brings blessing to the generations coming after you. Your love and care releases a desire to bless and not curse. Elders represent and contribute a lot to society because they provide wisdom, guidance, and direction for the younger generation, having gone through the road of life. It is a scriptural principleplease read Genesis 27:129." />
