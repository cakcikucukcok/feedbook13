  <title>Miracles Happen - Terry G. Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles happen every day, yet sometimes we need to open our hearts and minds to see them. In Miracles Happen, author Terry G. Price shares a compilation of stories detailing some of the unusual happenings and miracles that have occurred in his life and to those close to him.
From getting locked in a freezer as a child and being found, to finding relief from hiccups, to near-death experiences and ghostly encounters, Price tells how his prayers to the Lord were answered. While narrating a wide range of interesting situations, he discusses how many times failures turned into blessings.
With photos, poems, puppet play, and song lyrics included, Miracles Happen gives credit to Jesus for the many blessings hes received in his lifetime. It sends a message of encouragement to others. It discusses how God gave Price the vision that led to wonderful miracles which drew him closer to the Lord and also changed the life of others." />
