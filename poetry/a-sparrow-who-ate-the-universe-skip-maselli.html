  <title>A Sparrow Who Ate the Universe - Skip Maselli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Skip Maselli is a brilliant word alchemist. He pulls from the collective subconscious with the mastery of a genius, transforming our universal longing into an art that feels like an oasis to the thirsting traveler. His poetry has a sense of familiarity, a direct passage to the heart, infused with a new passion that makes its beats more audible. Reading him will inspire you and reconnect you to the deeper source of wisdom and beauty once known by every soul, yet only accessed daily by a few. 
 Andra Balt, Author, Founder and Editor in Chief of Rebelle Society
Masellis poetry is a reminder of the subtlest truths from the beyondlike the prophet Khalil Gibran, his verses are reminders presented in a different light... His couplets set the heart aflame with unquenchable longing until it is reduced to ashes He sings about love in beautiful versesbecause his soul itself has become a song of the beloved, a melody in harmony with and a strain of the music coming from the abode of the unseen. Maselli knows that he himself is not the author of all these verses, rather he is like the flute, [awaiting] the beloveds breath....
 Dr. Ahmad Javid Sarwari Qaderi, Sufi teacher and writer
Books like this one, the rare gems in the tradition of Rumi and Hafiz, are not just forms of expression, but dialogues between the different facets of ones own self, travelogues through the terrains of the heart and soul, and the saga of stories woven within storiesReading Masellis poetry has the effect of being entranced by all the gates to an otherworldly wisdom, which lay hidden before un-trained eyes. The doors into the realm of love: where wandering is a gift and pain is a treasure.
