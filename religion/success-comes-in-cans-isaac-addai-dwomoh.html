  <title>Success Comes in Cans - Isaac Addai - Dwomoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was born in Kumasi Ghana in 1958. I had my secondary education at St. Peters Secondary School where I studied Economic, Government and Accounting. The first twenty five years of my life was spent in Kumasi, teaching in one of the international schools and then as a businessman travelling from country to country in West Africa inporting goods. In early 1985 I left the county and travelled to England. Here in London I went to Hampstead Bible College for four years, and also at Midlands Bible College. 
It was here in London that I met my wife Comfort. We have been married twenty years with a lovely daughter Abigail 18, and three sons, Joshua 16, Isaac Jr.13 Michael David 10. I have been working in the hospitality industry for some time and as a result the family decided to have our own hotel. The thirty bed room Hotel will soon be open in one of the cities in Ghana. 
In 1992 I after graduation I was ordained as a minister of the Gospel. In 1994 Pentecost life Ministries International was established. This is where men women and Children are thought the wonderful and redemptive works of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. With the powerful anointing to teach many are being saved and are coming to the revelation knowledge of Christ. Since then the ministry have continue to grow and expand. We now have branches in other countries. As President of Pentecost life Ministries International, I do pray for more expansion into other nations for this is the will of God. I now spend most of my spear time reading and writing." />
