  <title>The Embedding Method for Electronic Structure - John Inglesfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The embedding method was originally developed for calculating the electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces, but its flexibility has provided a powerful computational tool in many other areas of condensed matter physics and nanoscience. It has also been extended to solving electromagnetic problems, with applications in photonics and plasmonics. In this book, John Inglesfield, who originated the method and has been a pioneer in its usage, brings together the different aspects of embedding and its applications in an authoritative text. This serves both as an accessible starting point for graduate students in physics and chemistry wishing to understand and use the method, and as an authoritative reference source for those already familiar with the method. A feature of the book is that the author draws connections between the embedding method and other concepts and techniques in theoretical physics such as open systems, self-energy, and the R-matrix method. By bringing together its different aspects, this text consolidates the embedding method, and will serve as a catalyst for its further development as an important tool in computational and theoretical physics.&lt;/P&gt;" />
