  <title>Gentleman Jack - Christina James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DI Tim Yates and DS Juliet Armstrong are investigating the widespread theft of expensive farm machinery and keep on drawing a blank. They don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re looking for a gang, an individual or an organised network; nor can they find any trace of the machinery once it&#39;s been stolen. Meanwhile, local property developer and philanthropist Jack Fovargue is assaulted in the street, and seems reluctant to help find his assailant. Visiting one of Fovargue&#39;s building sites to persuade him to make a statement, DI Yates sees a quad that he thinks may have been stolen from a nearby farm a few days before. Fovargue denies all knowledge of the vehicle, while his foreman says he picked it up cheaply from a traveller. Tim obtains a warrant to search the site and discovers something far more sinister than another missing machine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
