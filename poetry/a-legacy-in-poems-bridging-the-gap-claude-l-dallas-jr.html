  <title>A Legacy in Poems: Bridging the Gap - Claude L. Dallas Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Title: 
INITIATING A LEGACY OF POEMS WAS DESIGNED TO:
	Provide a written record of my life- transforming decisions and experiences for my descendants.  It is something that I wished had been available for me to assist in my positive self-development as a young man.
	Record the lessons on life learned from my father and his father to be passed down to future generations.
	To serve as a guide and template for others who desires to reflect upon their relationships and experiences.
	Encourage other men in refining and expanding their sense of purpose and destiny.
	Serve as an example to many of my cultural and spiritual brothers of the importance of recording a written legacy.
Legacy Journal of Personal Transformation is an open-ended work of poems and other literature that will be used in the context of speaking with my offspring and their progeny to fill in the dash between the date on which I was born and the date on which I physically depart this dear earth.   It is my intention to continue to record my personal lifes journey, the significant events in my life and the decisions that resulted.  
May my vulnerability expressed in these writings assist my heirs and others in becoming more aware of the presence, plans, power and purpose of God. May they treasure the blessings of many past generations who have prayed for them and labored knowing that they would never see this day. 
1.	Proverbs 13:22
A good man leaves an inheritance for his children&#39;s children, but a sinner&#39;s wealth is stored up for the righteous." />
