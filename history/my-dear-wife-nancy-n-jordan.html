These letters came to me from my father and I have transcribed them to make them more accessible. They provide a unique and interesting view of events during the war. Charlie wrote his letters to entertain and inform the readers at home. They make you think you are eavesdropping on a veterans recollections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Jordan, a native of Kalamazoo, Michigan, is retired in Fairfax, Virginia, with her husband, Douglas, after having lived in a number of places around the country.
