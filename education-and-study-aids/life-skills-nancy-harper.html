&lt;p&gt;&quot;The student-athletes in our program have classified the Life Skills course instruction as one of their collegiate academic highlights. They comment on the excitement of the class instructor, the creativity of content, and the confidence the instructional materials contribute to their post-college experience.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Professor Harper&#39;s life skills course is a necessity for the overall development and education of our student-athletes. We encourage every one of our young players to take advantage of this opportunity.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Pete Lembo, Head Football Coach, Ball State University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Life Skills component of an education is as important as any that we can teach. It helps our young people deal with real life situations that will allow them to grow as students, athletes and people.
Tim Buckley, Assistant Basketball Coach, Indiana University&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Life Skills class has taught me so much. Even two years later, I found myself in a particular situation and I remembered what was taught me in this class. Ethan W. Hall, student athlete at Ball State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nancy has done a tremendous job of helping our basketball student-athletes adjust to college life with their Life Skills class. Nancy&#39;s ability to relate, engage, and mentor the student-athletes in their transition to college independence allows me to focus more of my time on their athletic development. The Life Skills class is an absolute must for my student-athletes!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
