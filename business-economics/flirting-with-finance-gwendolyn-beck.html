  <title>Flirting with Finance - Gwendolyn Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you achieving your dreams and goals?  Are you where you want to be financially and personally? Are you tired of making financial mistakes and ready to get ahead?  In FLIRTING WITH FINANCE, our main character Samantha Davis learns about finance the hard way.  Its complicated at first, but determined to uncover the true game of finance; she learns what her incredible best friend, Morgan, describes as a different language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLIRTING WITH FINANCE uses real life stories to explain complex financial concepts in an easy to understand way.  Join Samantha as she goes from college to career: conquering checking accounts, retirement accounts, investing, knowing the difference between a stock and a bond, buying real estate, cars, getting an inheritance, and eventually, after taking a few bumps along the way, making smart personal choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of cramming facts and laws into the text, we broke up the endless information into a captivating story which contains all sorts of useful, humorous and even fascinating information to make the task of balancing your financial life with your fun life diverting, and even downright entertaining! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLIRTING WITH FINANCE will place you on the road to financial confidence, and help you achieve financial freedom!&lt;/p&gt;" />
