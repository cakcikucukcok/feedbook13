  <title>The Way It Works - William Kowalski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Walter Davis is young, handsome, intelligent, dynamic and personable. The product of a bi-racial marriage but abandoned by his father as a young child, he prides himself on three things: his drive to succeed, his fine clothes and never having been late for anything in his life. Walter is also homeless. The medical expenses that came with his mother&#39;s brief and unsuccessful battle against cancer have left him destitute. Still, ever the optimist, Walter believes that if he lives in his car for a few months, he will have the time he needs to find a good job in the business world and turn his life around. His situation gets more complicated when he finds himself attracted to a girl he meets at the mailing center where he keeps a post box. But trying to impress a girl when you have no fixed address proves difficult, and when he&#39;s caught in a lie, she shuns his company. Walter&#39;s struggles grow when his car is impounded and he can&#39;t afford to pay the fine. Only resilience, ingenuity and his drive to succeed can bring Walter back from the brink of despair." />
