  <title>The Beauty of Us - Kristen Proby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Kristen Proby delivers another sizzling novel in her delectable and sexy Fusion series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riley Gibson is over the moon at the prospect of having her restaurant, Seduction, on the Best Bites TV network. This could be the big break she&amp;#8217;s been waiting for. But the idea of having an in-house show on a regular basis is a whole other matter. Their lives would be turned upside down, and convincing Mia, her best friend and head chef of Seduction, that having cameras in her kitchen every day is a good idea is daunting. Still, Riley knows it&amp;#8217;s an opportunity she can&amp;#8217;t afford to pass on. And when she meets Trevor Cooper, the show&amp;#8217;s executive producer, she&amp;#8217;s stunned by their intense chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trevor&amp;#8217;s sole intention is to persuade Riley to allow Best Bites TV to do a show on her restaurant. But when he walks into Riley&amp;#8217;s office, he stops dead in his tracks. The professional, aloof woman on the phone is incredibly beautiful and funny. But can he convince her that he&amp;#8217;s interested in Riley for himself? Or is he using the undeniable pull between them to persuade her to agree to his offer?&lt;/p&gt;" />
