  <title>How to Accumulate Wealth - Christopher Chima  Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is designed to guide young investors who desire to make the right
financial choices. It teaches the fundamentals of investing and the mechanics
for accumulating wealth. Regardless of your income level, you can accumulate
wealth only if you have the burning desire to achieve such a goal. This book
will answer all your questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the best attributes of this book is that it lays down the principles and
basic concepts of investments in a very simple language. It breaks down all the
sophisticated ideas of investing to very simple terms. This takes away the fear
and intimidation that some people may have toward investing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book
provides a lot of insights in a simplified fashion.
This book will help you to have a better appreciation and understanding
of various investment instruments and the stock market. In particular,
the last chapter of this book contains a glossary of terms. This is probably the
largest collection of investment terms that you can find in any book.
The fundamental and simplistic explanation of these complex concepts, and
stock market jargon, is what makes this book a winner." />
