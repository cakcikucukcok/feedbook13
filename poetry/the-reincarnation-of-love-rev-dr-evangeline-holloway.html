  <title>The Reincarnation of Love - Rev. Dr. Evangeline Holloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reincarnation of Love was inspired by real life experiences and my ideology about love and passion for someone you love. The various love poems are meant for the institution of marriage. They reveal that Christians can be sexy and expressive also. The Reincarnation of Love has three prongs: the inspiration, the pain, and the love. It addresses the concepts of love infusion, love transfusion, a captive heart, and having a love infection. These concepts are brilliantly brought out in the various poems as well as the twisted plays of love versus new love. Then there are times when the new love appears to be infected and then resurrects itself again as the guiding light. Just when you think you have it all figured out, love reincarnates itself again in the exotic, sensual, yet tasteful metaphoric forms brought out in &quot;Queen Crab Meat,&quot; &quot;Coffee Shop,&quot; &quot;Computer Story,&quot; and the &quot;Attribute to Perfume.&quot; The book also addresses the controversy of &quot;Women in the Pulpit&quot; and provides words of encouragement and enlightenment to help empower individuals to move forward in life. Sit back and experience an emotional, spiritual, and challenging journey through the various phases of pain, love, romance, and spirituality like never before. Once you start reading this book, you cannot put it down." />
