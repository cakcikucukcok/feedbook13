  <title>The Glorious Grace of God Unveiled - Dr. Glenn E. Clifton, Dr. Jim Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is this Amazing Grace &lt;br /&gt;
that saves us? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This world could not fully understand what divine grace is till it was disclosed through the incarnation of Jesus, the Christ. After 2,000 years the believing followers of the Christ still cannot fully apprehend the depth of that grace. Even today this incredible salvation continually amazes those of us who have been touched by Gods grace. &lt;br /&gt;
It is my prayer that this observant and grace-filled, faith-filled book will help you fulfill your fundamental vocation in life: to grow in holiness and to be conformed to the image of God. Grace is the only answer to mankinds need for meaning, purpose and fellowship with God. &lt;br /&gt;
This book will help you learn more of the lavish abundance of grace freely given to all Gods children, and discover just how powerfully His grace moves in a life surrendered to Christ! This book is filled with quotations, Scripture, and heartwarming stories. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book will encourage you to embrace and enjoy Gods grace - and freely extend it to others. As you experience your true identity in Christ, youll come to know Amazing Grace as not just a song but as your true way of life! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you among all who are sanctified (Acts 20:32 NIV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
