  <title>Ecrou Borgne - Hui Ling Neo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an acorn-nutshell idea of poems and short stories written when I was recovering from my illness. 
A poem about my book: The Woody Perennial
The woody perennial is not woody.
The plant is a stalk of pricks.
The color of stem is olive green.
It stands strong.
The woody perennial has flowers.
The plant has an arrondissement of petals.
Its petals fall one by one in loving sequence.
It is romantic.
If you think literature is interesting, you will find this book enticing to readers as it is a compilation of poems and short stories describing my life as a wanderer when I am struggling with my illness. Well, I recovered, and this is my book with encounters of my life as a poet. I love poetry writing and have wrote many poems in my entire youth life. These are the better ones that I have handpicked and chosen for this book entitled Ecrou Borgne (translated as acorn nut). I love French literature, and that is why I wrote this book with a French title to it.
An acorn is a blessing pine object, and within the deep forests, it grew beautifully. I chose this title so that we can find resilience in overcoming the obstacles in our everyday life. I enjoyed writing this book, and I hope that you, as a reader, will enjoy reminiscing through it too." />
