  <title>The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls - John R. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Probably the most infamous story in the Sherlock Holmes canon is &quot;The Final Problem&quot; as it relates the facts of the death/murder of the master detective at Reichenbach Falls. On May 4, 1891, the detective met his archenemy Professor Moriarty on a ledge above the falls; the two became locked in a titanic hand-to-hand struggle before both tumbled over the precipice, presumably to their deaths, as witnessed afar by Dr.Watson. The outcry against the death of such a popular character was so great that in 1901 Conan Doyle was forced to give in to the pressure of his fan mail. He resurrected the detective by claiming that Holmes had managed to grab a tuft of grass during the fall into the &quot;dreadful cauldron&quot; and so had lived to solve another mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what really happened that infamous day at Reichenbach Falls and why did Holmes disappear in the aftermath? And what of the infamous Moriarty? How did a noble mathematician become the Napoleon of Crime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls&lt;/i&gt; provides these answers and more. It turns out that the events were not just witnessed by Watson but by another young detective of the Victorian era--Carnacki the Ghost Finder. Carnacki rescues an amnesiac gentleman from the base of the falls only to find himself and his companion doggedly pursued by an evil mastermind whose shadowy powers may reach from the bloody crime scenes of White Chapel to far beyond the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with Holmesian lore and thrilling encounters evocative of Doyle&#39;s work in the &lt;i&gt;Strand &lt;/i&gt;magazine, &lt;i&gt;The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls&lt;/i&gt; will undoubtedly join the ranks of such successful Holmesian pastiches as &lt;i&gt;The Seven Percent Solution&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The West End Horror&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Murder by Decree.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
