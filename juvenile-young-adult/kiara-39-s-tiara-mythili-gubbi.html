  <title>Kiara&#39;s Tiara - Mythili Gubbi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kiaras Tiara is based on the theme that one beautiful heart can make a difference. It is a young-adult fiction story, showcasing transformations, perceptions, and love: love between a father and daughter, love between best friends; love that exists between grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews; and love that binds people without a blood relation and call themselves family; but most importantly, it highlights the love that a teenage girl has for the world. The name of this girl is Kiara. Introducing Kiaraa chirpy, smiling, and affectionate fifteen-year-old Indian girl, living in the United States, who was raised by a single parent. The story traces the evolution of her character from her life in a cocoon to a scintillating butterfly-like persona. Life only throws the unexpected at those who can handle it. Kiara overcame life-threatening obstacles in unconventional ways. She became an inspiration and set examples for others, by aspiring for the moon but reaching far beyond other galaxies. Necessity and belief can give an immense amount of strength and courage. Sometimes, all you need to do is believe because hope is all you have. If you really want something, and your heart truly believes in it, then nothing can keep you two apart. The entire universe itself will make sure that you end up with your hearts desire. 
Kiaras Tiara is a symbol of her strength, optimism, perseverance, and conviction." />
