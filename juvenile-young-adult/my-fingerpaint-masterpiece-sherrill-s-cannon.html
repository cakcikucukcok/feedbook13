  <title>My Fingerpaint Masterpiece - Sherrill S.  Cannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever seen a &quot;work of art&quot; worth millions that looks like something your child just brought home from school? The dual perspective of &quot;Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder&quot; and just a little bit of &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot; is evident in this clever artwork story of a child who paints a fingerpaint print in class and then loses it in the wind on the way home. Illustrated from the point of view of a child, whose identity is left to the imagination of the reader since all of the illustrations are what the child sees, the fingerpaint print is interpreted by official &quot;judges&quot; as well as bystanders. Should people be influenced by what others see, or use their own knowledge to make their judgments? This is the sixth rhyming children&#39;s book by this award-winning author, whose other bestselling books include Manner-Man, Gimme-Jimmy, The Magic Word, Peter and the Whimper-Whineys, and Santa&#39;s Birthday Gift." />
