  <title>Remembered Names - Donley Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ELLINGTON
The Dukes patrician mother passed
in May of nineteen thirty-fi ve.
His calling, even then, was cast,
but composing took a nosedive.
He fi lled her hearse with fl owers,
sorrowing in his solitude.
He bore a battleground of powers.
Then came, In a Sentimental Mood.
Its dancers took the tune from there,
and spread its spell from coast to coast,
stepping to it with such style, such fl air
that many c1ubbers could but toast.
My folks did the fox-trot to his band,
in Depression-dizzy Dallas,
Deep Ellum,1 where colored folks could stand.
Saw his show in Tylers Palace.2
Ghost trains would trumpet past our home,
passing its porch with Pullman cars
that carried white folks to and from
towns with names like Texarkana.
Those evening trains were lit like stars . . .
all the way to Corsicana.
My dad would play on our piano,
plunking out some boogies bitter bars.
A railroad clerk, he ran with woe,
drugging that journey with his gin . . .
Born for Christ in nineteen thirty-fi ve,
I bear a cross of love within,
to help somebodys heart survive.
Our darkest years saw Dukes comeback.
For Duke would joy his band with jive,
trumpeting his A Train on Loves track.
1Deep Ellum is on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas.
2the only black theater in Tyler, Texas.

Remembered Names 139
ON ELLINGTONIA
If you dig elegance,
his music is your mistress.
Take the A Train to dance
up in Harlem, with fi nesse,
if only in memory;
its in my solitude,
in my souls reverie.
In a sentimental mood
Im moving, Im praying:
Dear Lord, in heaven above,
keep us sweetly swaying
to Ellingtons deep groove.
Johnny Hodges is so hip,
when he swings Warm Valley,
that hell take you on a trip
to glory, to Gods alley;
hell give you a poets tip:
It dont mean a thing, man,
if it aint got that swing
a fantasy, black and tan!
Such love is everlasting.
The Duke would love you madly!
For his sound is so haunting,
as we glide to it, gladly.
