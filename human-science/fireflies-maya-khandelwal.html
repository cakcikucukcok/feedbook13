  <title>Fireflies - Maya Khandelwal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trisha knows she isnt a kid anymore. Maybe she isnt exactly an adult woman yet but she is really ready to move on. She often worries that she isnt getting breasts like most of her friends. She is worried lest she should be the first one in the whole class to get periods or maybe the last one orwhat if she got her first period right in the middle of the class and bleed right through her pants and everyone saw itwhat if her pad someday fell out of her bag? 
OMG! This was the day. 
Mom, what if I get it in the class? she had expressed her deep most concern to her Mum one day. 
If you get cramps in the class, tell the teacher you have a headache and ask to go to the nurses office. 
And what am I to tell the nurse? Trisha had asked foolishly. 
Tell the nurse the truth of-course, but you dont have to announce to the whole class that you have menstrual cramps. 
Periods. 
Acne. 
Body-odour. 
Unwanted hair. 
Andmuch more. 
Those are the biggies every girl in the class is wondering about.
