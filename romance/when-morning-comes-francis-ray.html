  <title>When Morning Comes - Francis Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her unforgettable new novel &lt;i&gt;When Morning Comes&lt;/i&gt;, Francis Ray delivers an emotionally powerful tale about the families we build, the choices we make, and how we find love and family along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cade Mathis learned early that he was not the son of the man who raised him. His adoptive father, a cruel, bitter man, had always been quick to tell him that he was a bastard and an embarrassment to the rich society family whose daughter got pregnant with him. So when Cade received a full scholarship to college, he was only too happy to leave the only home he had ever known behind and never looked back. Now a successful doctor and one of the best neurosurgeons in the state, the only thing he still wants are answers about where he came from. What he doesn&#39;t expect to find is Sabrina Thomas, the new patient advocate at his hospital, or how this woman will lead him to the family he has been searching for and a love he never expected to find.&lt;/p&gt;" />
