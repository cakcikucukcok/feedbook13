      <meta name="description" content="Amanda Anderson lives in the little town of Somersville, with her mom, dad, her little sister Amy, and her big brother Bobby. She is in love with Jeff Shaffer, but her mom won&#39;t let her date. Amanda modeled at the mall. She let the photographer (Mitch Jackson) think that she was eighteen. She signed papers releasing her photos. She thought they would end up in the trash, but much to her surprise, they ended up on the cover of Vogel magazine. Now Mitch Jackson wants her to model again and is offering her an enormous sum of money. Her mother doesn&#39;t know. What will she tell her mother? Should she tell her mother knowing that she lied about her age? Will her mother let her date Jeff Shaffer?" />
