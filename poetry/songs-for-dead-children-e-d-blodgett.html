  <title>Songs for Dead Children - E.D. Blodgett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a series of poems inspired by Gustav Mahler&#39;s Kindertotenlieder, E.D. Blodgett searches for meaning amidst grief. In the contemplative gentleness of his words, he finds the special light children possess in their state of unknowing as they encounter the world. These sparse poems move through acceptance and resignation to the solace that exists in the word. Blodgett&#39;s poetry will speak to readers who have experienced loss, are exploring grief, or want to find a way to connect with stillness.
as bells that ring through
the winter air
the clear laughter of children
sings in the trees
almost like brooks
bursting in spring
the air stands up
its joy unbound
the breath of it
the bright birth of stars" />
