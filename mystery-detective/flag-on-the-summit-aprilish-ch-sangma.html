  <title>Flag on the Summit - Aprilish. Ch. Sangma.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel Flag On the Summit is about the dreams of two young girls Jentilla and Palmina who belonged to two humble families of Bolchugri, a non descript place in a non descript town. They lived in the environment where even dreaming big is impossible. They grew together since childhood along with their other friends Chinche, Hilla and Milche. While Palmina wanted to become a doctor, Jentilla wanted to become magistrate. With those two aims like two flags waving at them they began their journey towards it. But halfway, Jentillas father and the sole bread earner of the family died and Jentilla went into depression. The people of the Bolchugri was ignorant of depression and was no help to her but rather ridiculed her and taunted her. Even her own mother was no help to her depression as to what it caused it and how to bring her into normalcy. With no help from the society her condition grew worse. But against all odds, Palmina went onto become a doctor with the relentless support of her parents and became a Psychiatrist. She stuck steadfastly into her decision and never give up her dream. Chinche was the only daughter of the drunkard father, neighbour and childhood friend of Palmina with two young brothers in her care. Right from the early childhood after her mothers death she became a mother to them as well as a sister while at the same time looking for care and love which she found in her relationships but only short time. Nobody understood her search for love and care but branded her as a scarlet girl. With that tag she lived but found that in the end. While Hilla, another childhood friend of Palmina and Jentilla was the only daughter of well off doctor parents and never lacked for anything in life but was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, Milche was the only daughter of rich Widows daughter and never knew the hard time. But all the five friends, even if different in their ages grew together and shared lots of childhood adventures." />
