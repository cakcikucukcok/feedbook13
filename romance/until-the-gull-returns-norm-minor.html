  <title>Until the Gull Returns - Norm Minor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The term &quot;Boston Brahmins&quot; refers to a class of wealthy, educated, elite members of Boston society. In this world one does what one is expected to do, and for one certain young woman, who has thus far fulfilled every one of the requirements expected of her, there remains the most important requirement  marriage.
Rebecca Peabody Cunningham is a tall beauty -- wealthy, educated, talented and a Boston Brahim of the first order; Becky Cunningham is the it girl. 
Rebeccas life is on a course that this socially elite world expects her to take  without question. 
But Beckys internal thoughts and desires cause her life to veer off that course like an errant rocket! Shes making all the wrong moves  or is she?
The gorgeous and virginal Rebecca Cunningham is in the midst of planning her wedding to fellow Brahmin, Derek Sanderson. Derek is handsome and desirable and the perfect match; marrying Derek will fulfill all the goals that both of their upper crust families have for the two of them, and is set to be the social event of the season. 
But Becky has a dream in her heart that she is unable to shake. It centers on a sensual and mysterious man she has seen only occasionally in her life, whom she names Chandler. He has stolen her heart and invaded her wildest sexual fantasies. 
For the first time in her life, confident and steady Rebecca Peabody Cunningham is at odds with Becky, and has a life decision to make -- will she follow her expected plan of marriage to Derek Sanderson, or follow her shaky heart and unrelenting desires? 
The day of the wedding has arrived; the social elite are in the pews the pressure is on for Becky. Will fate step in and change the course of her life or is it all about a well-laid plan hatched by one free-spirited Ms. Jane Potter, the very best friend a girl can have? 
The marriage is scuttled and the powerful family patriarch Eliot Sanderson declares, You have publicly insulted and embarrassed this entire family, and that, young lady, is something we will neither forgive nor forget.
The decision that Becky Cunningham makes on this fateful day leads her on an unforgettable adventure. We travel with her, experiencing a tumultuous journey of twists and turns -- as money, power and intrigue lead to a chain of events that change her life forever, leading her to a most unexpected and wonderful life  and leaving us with a valuable lesson to always follow your heart." />
