  <title>A Casualty of War - Hannah Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The scene is often romanticized: the emotional, happy reunion of loved ones embracing their beloved soldier, returned home from his time on the battlefield, relieved to have him safely home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if he doesnt come home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if he makes the decision, while deployed, that he no longer wishes to be reunited with the family he left behind? This is one such story of many too often repeated, one of a faithful wife, abandoned by her soldier, left to fend for herself and pick up the tattered pieces of what remains of her life, without an understanding of what became of the man she once knew and loved. War has many consequences, not only for the people who enlist to fight it, but for the people who are left behind and whose lives are forever changed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;" />
