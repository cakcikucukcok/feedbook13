  <title>Stories of the Wracken Sacker - Julious Walter Elmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My interest in my grandfather&#39;s war history of the Gee-Johnson&#39;s 15th AR Infantry Regiment started with a conversation
between myself and Dr. Robert Walz; a History professor at Southern Arkansas University, who had a friend, Dr. John Ferguson, an AR State 
Historian who found an article written by Benjamin F. Cooling, a park historian at Fort Donelson National Military Park. The only information I had
of my grandfather&#39;s service was that he was in Johnson&#39;s AR 15th Company. So this began lots of studying and research. I have compiled
some history for my decendants living in South Arkansas from 1861-1865, through four years of war and then the reconstruction the next 
twelve years. My goal is to leave my family with history of Colonel&#39;s Gee and Johnson and the 15th AR. This book contains the results of that
research." />
