  <title>Formosa Calling - Allan J. Shackleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recently occupied by the Nationalist Chinese regime, Taiwan in early 1947 was a powder keg. Anger at the corrupt misrule of the new government erupted into protests and riots, which quickly became an island-wide uprising. The response from the Nationalists was brutal and overwhelming &amp;ndash; a weeks-long massacre in which local leaders and intellectuals were systematically slaughtered. Estimates of the dead range from ten thousand to thirty thousand. The killings became known as the &amp;ldquo;228 Massacre&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;228 Incident&amp;rdquo;, or simply &amp;ldquo;228&amp;rdquo;, after the date of the first riots (February 28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allan J. Shackleton was a New Zealand officer with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration assigned to in Taiwan at the time. His eyewitness account of the massacre is an important document for&amp;nbsp;understanding modern Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s founding tragedy. Shackleton tried for years to get it published, but it was deemed too politically sensitive during the Cold War, when &amp;ldquo;Free China&amp;rdquo; was an ally of the Western world. Finally, after Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s first democratic presidential election, Shackleton&amp;rsquo;s son was approached by a publisher and the first edition appeared in 1998, fifty years after it was written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Camphor Press edition has been reset and carries a number of&amp;nbsp;minor corrections to the 1998 edition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
