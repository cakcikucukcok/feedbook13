  <title>Balm in Gilead - Letha Vinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Looking through the eyes of a woman who encountered cancer and survived, this Memoir is a beautifully written book showing us not only the aspects of her bravery and courage but also of her faith in God and how it never wavers as she takes us on a journey through the trials and tribulations of becoming a cancer survivor. She allows us to see how she relies on her faith to not only conquer her own fears going this ordeal but also how she has to be strong for her mother who has also fought this horrible battle as well.
Evangelist Jarvette Lowery
Upon reading the first few lines I thought to myself,I have already heard and lived this&quot;. Reading further into the authors gripping experiences, she determinedly embraces her sufferings with a compelling faith in God that sets her totally free in the depths of His love. This is a beautiful gift of story that gladdened my heart and restored my faith in seeing the beauty in overcoming hardship and anguish.

Balm in Gilead is written in a manner to which any reader can relate. It touches the very core of who we are in Christ and guides you through an unimaginable struggle. The authors personal narrative allows any reader to understand how being encouraged, positive, and supported will bring you through your journey. It is because of the authors honesty that the reader can see themselves.
