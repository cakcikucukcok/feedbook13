It addresses the ten main fears in our society: fear of failure, fear of success, fear of rejection, and fear of death just to name a few. We all know what it feels to be afraid and confused about our future; however, sometimes we do not know why we have to endure certain difficulties nor do we know how to rise above our fears because they have become part of our lives to a point where we have stopped fighting against them.
