  <title>Rush to Judgment - David Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Violent Crimes detectives Charlie Dent and Reese Barrett arrive at a murder scene only to find a guy in a suit, bled out and dead on the floor of a shop. Imagine their surprise when they turn the body over and recognize Richard Carver, a burglary detective working out of the East Dallas station. Its not long before the entire police force is on the hunt for a cop killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the crime is clear. The shop owner is little help, since all he remembers is that the shooter was black. There was a mistake with 911 that possibly cost Carver his life, and now, Carvers former partner is out for blood. As police hysteria rises, a black man named Kindred James becomes the prime suspect but ends up shot by the authorities chasing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James survives the firefight, and cops all over Texas seem convinced of his guilt. Charlie and Reese arent sure James is their killer, though. Black Lives Matter enters the forefront as the investigators are attacked from all sides. In order to prove the innocence of the young black man, they must sift through red herrings and misdirection from friends, authorities, and even the media before James ends up dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
