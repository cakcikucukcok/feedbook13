  <title>On Angels Wings - Heather Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More than 200 years ago privateers and spies roamed the Long Island
shores As a child, Heather Adams grew up on the East end of the island,
daydreaming about these events. The result is her premier novel, On Angels
Wings. She now resides in Delaware, where she writes full time.
Star crossed lovers, Duke Monroe Enderby who fancies himself an
adventurer like his hero Odysseus, and Angela Anderson, an equally
adventuresome girl, find themselves on opposite sides of the Atlantic,
separated by scorned servant Polly. Monroe begins his own twenty year
Odyssey before he can be reunited with his beloved.
In 1755 Angela Andersons father dies and turns her life upside down.
After fi nding that she is a lords bastard and then being sold to a brothel,
she leaves her home and meets Duke Monroe Enderby. He marries her
unbeknownst to all but a blind man of God and after becoming pregnant
with Monroes child, Angela decides to leave Enderby Hall to protect
Monroes family name. Helped by scheming servant Polly who covets
Monroe for herself, Angela escapes to Gray Corners, a solitary place
where all noblemen send their pregnant mistresses.
After spending ten heartbroken years there, she and her son Weylin
travel to America where the Revolutionary War is getting ready to break
out. Her troubles really begin when the British plot to kidnap her in
an attempt to stop her son from helping the Sons of Liberty! Actual history
is interwoven to give On Angels Wings an adventuresome spirit as well as
the romance that three continents, two wars and twenty years cannot kill.
