  <title>Netsuke: Japanese Life and Legend in Miniature - Edwin C. Symmes, Jr., Hih Prince Norihito Hazenplug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Featuring dozens of Japanese netsuke masterpieces and extensive commentary, this Japanese art book is a treasured collector&#39;s item.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Netsuke are superb miniature carvings, usually less than two inches high, that have been created by Japanese artists for over three hundred years.  During that time, they have portrayed almost every aspect of life and culture in Japan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These tiny carvings were traditionally used to prevent the cord attached to a gentleman&#39;s medicine box or tobacco pouch from slipping through the belt of his kimono.  Today they are highly collectible works of art.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Netsuke: Japanese Life and Legend in Miniature&lt;/I&gt; presents over seventy full-page color photographs of netsuke in enchanting settings. The accompanying text gives technical details about the netsuke as well as interesting commentaries relating the pieces to Japanese life and legend. Information on the carvers has also been provided whenever possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
