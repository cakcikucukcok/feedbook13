  <title>The G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. Soul Journey - Kathleen E. Walls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. Soul Journey realigns your thinking and understanding of yourself, your relationships, and what you want out of life. This book will help you clarify and strengthen your relationship with your spiritual entity, encourage you to use your gifts and talents, and lead you to design a personal roadmap to your G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. Life.
&lt;p&gt;
The G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. Soul Journey is all that the title suggests and more. Dr. Walls words serve as a soul-stirring, life-affirming, truth-seeking guide on your divine journey inward to unearth the greatest potential that dwells within you. The road map toward your awakening is contained in these pages, and the sage wisdom is both timely and timeless. So hold on with both hands because your greatest potential awaits you. And remember, divine voyages inevitably uncover hidden treasures.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Walls book is like a great sifter. She leads the reader to sift out all the muck, the dregs, and the darkness, until what remains is pure gold. Now, what you do with that gold is up to you.&lt;br&gt;
