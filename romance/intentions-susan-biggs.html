      <meta name="description" content="Megan Roberts, a stunning young elementary school teacher, arrives in town to make a new life after an unexpected breakup.  The last thing she is looking for is a new love.  
&lt;p&gt;
The green-eyed darling catches the attention of the infamous, small town wild man, Shane Cash.  His striking looks attract the attention of all the women in town, but his eye has turned in a new direction.  He&#39;s torn between his reputation and his feelings.  
&lt;p&gt;
After an unforgettable night together turns into a nightmare, these two find themselves on the run.  The situation is compounded when they realize they are falling in love with one another.  
&lt;p&gt;
Will this teacher be able to tame him or will he teach the quiet, lovely Megan to walk on the wild side?

As a web of deceit is woven and one is led away in handcuffs, can the other untangle the mystery and learn to forgive?" />
