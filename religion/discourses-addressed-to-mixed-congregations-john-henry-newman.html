  <title>Discourses addressed to Mixed Congregations - John Henry Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MY DEAR LORD,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I present for your Lordship&amp;rsquo;s kind acceptance and patronage the first work which I publish as a &amp;ldquo;Father of the. Oratory of St. Philip Neri. I have a sort of claim upon your permission to do so, as a token of my gratitude and affection toward your Lordship, since it is to you principally that I owe it, under God, that I am a client and subject, however unworthy, of so great a Saint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I found myself a Catholic, I also found myself in your Lordship&amp;rsquo;s district; and, at your suggestion, I first moved into your immediate neighbourhood, and then, when your Lordship further desired it, I left you for Rome.&amp;mdash;There it was my blessedness to be allowed to offer myself, with the condescending approval of the Holy Father, to the service of St Philip, of whom I had so often heard you speak before I left England, and whose bright and beautiful character had won my love and devotion, even when I was a Protestant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see then, my dear Lord, how much you have to do with my present position in the Church. But your concern with it is greater than I have yet stated; for I cannot forget, that when, in the year 1839, a doubt first crossed my mind of the tenableness of the theological theory on which Anglicanism is based, it was caused in no slight degree by the perusal of a controversial paper, attributed to your Lordship, on the schism of the Donatists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That the glorious intercession of St. Philip may be the reward of your faithful devotion to himself, and of your kindness to me is&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My dear Lord,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
while I ask your Lordship&amp;rsquo;s blessing on me and mine,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the earnest prayer of&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your affectionate friend and servant,&lt;br /&gt;
