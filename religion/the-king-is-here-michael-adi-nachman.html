  <title>The King Is Here - Michael Adi Nachman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;From Mashiach to Rabbi Kaduri: Dear Yitzhak It is written,Th e Scripture cannot be broken, and I say to you the Mishnah cannot be ignored. The Holy Spirit is on the move. Hillel says There is no more Mashiach for Israel. Akiva says No, No, No, It is Bar Kosiba, Chabad says But is it not Rabbi Sneerson of New York?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Israels halakah as we see it today was born after the destruction of the first and second temple. It is a faith lived out from the center of the Synagogue not the Temple. Many of her Torah practices were responses to the Temples destruction. Was it not born in Yavneh under the Sadducee Yochanan Ben Zaccheus? Is not its first book the Mishnah of Judah ha Nasi? They are waiting for Eliyah, the Mashiach and the Temple to be rebuilt.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Was not the Bar Enosh given authority in Zion in year 3790? Was he not authorised at the resurrection of his head, Rav Yahushua seed of Eve? Th e Good News of the revival of the dead and the age to come was taken to the twelve tribes of Israel and the seventy nations. The age of righteousness and justice where the Bar Enosh will judge the world begins on the seventh day from Adams descent from Paradise. (ca 5797). Is it time for the talmidim of Yavneh and the talmidim of Rabbi Yahushua to stop lying about one another and to start walking together in the Spirit? It is not by might, nor by power but my my Spirit Says Yahuah. with the Spirit of his lips shall he slay the wicked (Is 11)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In year 5766 (2006) a great master of the secrets of the Torah the late Rabbi Yitzchak Kaduri left a secret note with the name of Mashiach encoded on it and a prophecy. To the shock of the Jewish world the name he gave for the Mashiach was Yahushua, the same name as the head of the Notzrim, the anointed ones. How will Mashiach fulfill Rav Kaduris prophecy? This book is about that.&lt;/P&gt;" />
