  <title>Bread Is the Devil - Heather Rd Cdn Bauer, Kathy Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stop mindlessly inhaling the breadbasket and stop shoveling in the M&amp;M&#39;S-&lt;i&gt;Bread is the Devil&lt;/i&gt; is the solution to all of our diet saboteurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritionist Heather Bauer can count on the fingers of one hand the number of her clients who don&#39;t already know what they should eat to lose weight. So why can&#39;t they (and their best friend and their neighbor) lose weight? Because Bread is the Devil! Yes, that&#39;s Bauer&#39;s shorthand for the inevitable, demonic pull that certain bad habits exert on people who try to change their eating routines to drop the pounds. Many of us have been there: You had a sensible, healthy breakfast, high in protein with complex carbs. Ditto for lunch-soup and a salad with a warm rush of accomplishment and self control for dessert. But now it&#39;s dinnertime and you&#39;re out with friends: enter a large basket of warm, sliced, crusty sourdough bread with a little tub of chive butter. Suddenly you&#39;re in the seventh circle of hell-the one reserved for gluttons. Bread&#39;s not your devil? How about ice cream or chips or that big slab of buttercream-frosted birthday cake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bread Is the Devil&lt;/i&gt; will help you fight those hellish cravings that stop you from losing the weight you want. By identifying how certain factors promote overeating, Heather will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Identify the top-ten Diet Devils that challenge healthy eating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Provide specific, proven strategies that free you from these devils once and for all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Offer up a simple, flexible guide that will help you reach your goal in twenty-one days &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; make eating fun again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Suggest an easy, affordable, and doable shopping list for eating at home as well as great meal choices when eating out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bread is the Devil&lt;/i&gt; will help you say good-bye to your devils, for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
