Set to complete project SYNAPSE, a ten-year endeavor that he is certain will mark a significant point in time regarding human evolution, Chambers and his team of international scientists head to the Kerguelen Islands off the coast of Antarctica. Chambers has one goalto protect the information he has worked so hard to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chambers works on the finishing stages of the project, an inexplicable discovery is made, thrusting him into an enigmatic spiral that transports him deep into the Giza Necropolis of Egypt. In the company of new friends, Chambers is determined to go to any length to expose knowledge and more importantly, the truth.
