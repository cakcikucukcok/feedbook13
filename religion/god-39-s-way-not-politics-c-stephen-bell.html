  <title>God&#39;s Way, Not Politics - C Stephen Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No subject causes more irritation, frustration, and confusion than issues concerning government. God has timeless truths in the Bible for resolving the conflict between world politics and the righteousness of Gods kingdom. Misunderstanding these truths results in the actions of well-meaning Christians being viewed by the world as offensive, unloving, and hypocritical. The result causes major doubts in the credibility of the Church and limits belief in the loving message of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods Way, Not Politics&lt;/i&gt; brings a timely revelation to Gods people of truth in His Word, which has been buried by the cares of the world and rationalization of mans action out of ignorance of Gods love for mankind and Gods promises of peace, concerning what He can and wants to do. May the Holy Spirit reveal through honest consideration of His Word what God is saying. It is time for the Church to recognize our significance as empowered citizens of the kingdom of God on earth and be the conduit of loving witnesses for good in achieving the purpose our Creator intends. Acceptance of His plan and ways will unblock our prayers for healing our land and hasten our Lords return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
