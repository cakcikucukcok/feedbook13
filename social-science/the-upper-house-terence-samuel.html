  <title>The Upper House - Terence Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They come to Washington for varied and complex reasons--driven perhaps by some deep emotional commitment to an issue, or believing that their time in Congress can make their dream of the presidency a reality. No matter what their motivation or particular route, freshmen have three traits in common: they will be members of one of the most powerful deliberative bodies on the planet; they will have far less leverage and influence than they might have imagined; and finally, none of them--not even the most experienced political hand--will have any idea exactly what will take to succeed as a United States Senator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Upper House&lt;/i&gt;, political analyst Terrence Samuel journeys inside the legislative arm of the government to discover what makes a modern senator. He gets to the heart of the Senate and follows the people--Harry Reid, Jim Webb, Amy Klobuchar, Jon Tester, Chuck Schumer, Bob Corker--and the institution through displays of dazzling power, bewildering helplessness, and sacred traditions both ancient and modern.&lt;/p&gt;" />
