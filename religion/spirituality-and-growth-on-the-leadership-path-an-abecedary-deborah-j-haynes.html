  <title>Spirituality and Growth on the Leadership Path: An Abecedary - Deborah J. Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spirituality and Growth on the Leadership Path: An Abecedary offers lessons not usually taught about leadership, lessons learned over the author&#39;s more than thirty years in higher education and nonprofit organizations.  Few resources on leadership and administration attend to the inner life of a person in a leadership position. Many of this book&#39;s themes are therefore related to the inner moral and spiritual life. Some topics are prosaic, dealing with everyday activities. Throughout the book, pith instructions offer simple practical advice about the inner process and core values that may inform the leadership path. Haynes draws on the world&#39;s wisdom traditions--philosophy and religion, mysticism and theology, including indigenous beliefs and rituals--as rich resources for reconceiving leadership.  This abecedary includes drawings by artist Michael Shernick, which are paired with entries from the chronicles of experience, etymology and poetry, examples of contemplative practice and meditation, and metaphoric digressions. Common elements--such as lists and advice--mix with uncommon elements, including recipes. This primer will provide inspiration and insight for navigating the shoals, deep water, rocky coasts, wind, and sunny climes of the leadership journey." />
