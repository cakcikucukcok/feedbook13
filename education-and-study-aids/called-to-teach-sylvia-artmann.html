  <title>Called to Teach - Sylvia Artmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Called to Teach &lt;/i&gt;meets the critical needs of those of you who have decided that you want to teach, yet are unwilling or  unable to pursue the standard elementary teacher certification. Some of you may be  on the verge of completing a college degree for which you cannot find employment, and have been offered a job teaching at the elementary school of your local church. Others, unwilling to go through the currently popular shortcut methods of Alternative Certification, sense the great need for Christian teachers in public schools as a calling for Christian service. Desiring to show yourselves as workmen approved, you seek instruction that is both practical and grounded in the Christian calling by which you are led. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the burgeoning numbers of Christian parents who have decided to home-school your children? Although dedicated and bright, you may nevertheless be unaware of ways  to use the latest research to further your childrens educational development. Essential principles for every part of the elementary school curriculum are included, as well as suggestions for organizing time and materials and the nurturing of self-discipline in your child. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Called to Teach &lt;/i&gt;contains information on developmental expectations for children from age three  through ten years of age, along with the latest research on methods to effectively engage each age in a variety of curriculum  experiences to produce  lifetime learners. The motivation of inspiration from scripture is maintained throughout; emphasizing that any effective teaching method must relate to children as God created them, and that all truth is Gods truth. Each chapter has a keynote scripture, and other relevant scriptures are quoted as appropriate.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All subjects of the curriculum for age-three through sixth-grade are covered from research-based methods to practical teaching tips. By the final chapter the reader will emerge as being fully equipped for answering Gods call to teach.&lt;p&gt;" />
