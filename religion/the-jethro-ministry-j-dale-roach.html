&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhaustion and burnout are nothing new. It is not uncommon to hear of someone simply throwing in the towel and walking away from what looked like a good situation. Why does this happen? The answer to this question can be found in the advice that Jethro gave to Moses. Regardless of our role and responsibility as a leader, team member, and church member, the Creator never intended for any person to carry the load of life, work, or responsibilities by him- or herself. Jethro knew this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting bits of advice that Jethro gave to Moses was when he told Moses, If you continue to do this you will surely wear yourself and these people out (Exodus 18:18). A major call of any good leader is to seek out the talents of those they are leading. This search for talent was the advice of Jethro to Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we seek out the skills of other people, it will not always be easy. It will call us to take the time to find those who have untapped abilities and put them to work. It will encourage us to pace ourselves as leaders and not become frustrated when it takes a little more time to find help. Here is the key principle of The Jethro Ministry: You cannot do it by yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
