  <title>Cinder - Marissa Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestselling Series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing. A deadly plague ravages the population. From space, a ruthless lunar people watch, waiting to make their move. No one knows that Earth&#39;s fate hinges on one girl. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinder, a gifted mechanic, is a cyborg. She&#39;s a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister&#39;s illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai&#39;s, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world&#39;s future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marissa Meyer on &lt;i&gt;Cinder&lt;/i&gt;, writing, and leading men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Which of your characters is most like you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish I could say that I&#39;m clever and mechanically-minded like Cinder, but no--I can&#39;t fix anything. I&#39;m much more like Cress, who makes a brief cameo in Cinder and then takes a more starring role in the third book. She&#39;s a romantic and a daydreamer and maybe a little on the naïve side--things that could be said about me too--although she does find courage when it&#39;s needed most. I think we&#39;d all like to believe we&#39;d have that same inner strength if we ever needed it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where do you write?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a home office that I&#39;ve decorated with vintage fairy tale treasures that I&#39;ve collected (my favorite is a Cinderella cookie jar from the forties) and NaNoWriMo posters, but sometimes writing there starts to feel too much like work. On those days I&#39;ll write in bed or take my laptop out for coffee or lunch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you were stranded on a desert island, which character from &lt;/i&gt;Cinder&lt;i&gt; would you want with you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cinder, definitely! She has an internet connection in her brain, complete with the ability to send and receive comms (which are similar to e-mails). We&#39;d just have enough time to enjoy some fresh coconut before we were rescued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The next book in the Lunar Chronicles is called &lt;/i&gt;Scarlet&lt;i&gt;, and is about Little Red Riding Hood. What is appealing to you most about this character as you work on the book?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scarlet is awesome--she&#39;s very independent, a bit temperamental, and has an outspokenness that tends to get her in trouble sometimes. She was raised by her grandmother, an ex-military pilot who now owns a small farm in southern France, who not only taught Scarlet how to fly a spaceship and shoot a gun, but also to have a healthy respect and appreciation for nature. I guess that&#39;s a lot of things that appeal to me about her, but she&#39;s been a really fun character to write! (The two leading men in Scarlet, Wolf and Captain Thorne, aren&#39;t half bad either.)&lt;/p&gt;" />
