  <title>Listen to the Whisper - David Sample</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for Listen to the Whisper&lt;br /&gt;
The hand of God truly works in mysterious and glorious ways . Somehow David Sample has written exactly what I needed to hear to truly be freed in the hope, promise, and possibility that was put in me by my Creator. Truth has a way of doing that.&lt;br /&gt;
- Fran Wyatt, worship pastor, Willow Creek Chicago&lt;br /&gt;
David Sample has put together a wonderful, life-affirming collection of poetry in his book, Listen to the Whisper. ... There is not only wisdom in these poems, but also encouragement and reflection to ponder and be guided by. Read these poems not just with your head, but with your heart as well.&lt;br /&gt;
- John Harricharan, speaker and bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;
For the past fifteen years I have traveled with David Sample as a companion through both darkness and light. His songs, poetry, and insights have all arisen from his efforts to chart a path through the wilderness we call life and to reconcile his creative passion with his everyday work . His book serves as a guide for others, both those who are experiencing a depth of despair and those with a desire to deepen their personal spiritual journey.&lt;br /&gt;
- James M. Thomas Jr., PhD, MDiv, Trinity Episcopal Church&lt;br /&gt;
David Samples contribution to each of us through this book is no doubt inspired by God. I highly recommend that all of Davids readers take time to Listen to the Whisper.&lt;br /&gt;
