  <title>One Good Deed - Erin McHugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Erin McHugh had spent the better part of her adult life doing community work, but in more recent years, the minutiae of life and working as a bookseller kept her busy and away from those higher impulses. Then one day she learned a distant relative was actually going to be canonized. Was this a sign? What followed next was McHugh&amp;rsquo;s sincere urge to recapture a sense of charity, and so she set out on her birthday to do one good deed every day for an entire year. Maybe she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be saving orphans from burning buildings, but she wanted to take one small, daily detour and make someone else&amp;rsquo;s life just a little bit better. &lt;I&gt;One Good Deed&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring, smart, and frequently funny chronicle of that year, in which each page represents a day in McHugh&amp;rsquo;s journey to reclaim the better part of herself, inspiring readers to do the same.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;One Good Deed&lt;/I&gt;:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;Her memoir will inspire you to flex your do-gooder muscle without being preachy or a Pollyanna.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Fitness&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;7 Good Deeds That Could Change Your Life&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Redbook&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;Engaging, funny, wise, and winning.
