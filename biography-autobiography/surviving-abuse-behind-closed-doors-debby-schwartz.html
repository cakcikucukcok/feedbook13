  <title>Surviving Abuse Behind Closed Doors - Debby Schwartz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tells a horribly incredible, vivid, true story that brings you up close and personal with the turmoil and pain of being a victim of Child Abuse, and the ongoing struggles to deal with the psychological effects of coming to terms with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debby Schwartz, grew up in NYC with her family during the 1950&amp;#39;s and 1960&amp;#39;s was a victim of Child Abuse under the hand of her cruel parents from the age of 4.&lt;em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I loved? What was so wrong with me? God these very cruel people couldn&amp;rsquo;t be my real parents, my real parents had to be in heaven and they did love me, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her very sentiment rings throughout her ordeals. We can all find some commonality with the horrors experienced by Debby, though many of us have not experienced horror to the extreme that she has. However, it is the message of hope, strength, and love that prevails above the pain, anger, depression, and helplessness. Long after traumatic events have ended, the torment still continues. Each heart-wrenching situation, one worse than the next, ends with a light at the end of the tunnel. Her story is her transformation, of a breaking point, and a turning point, from a life of desperation to one of hope. Whether you&amp;#39;re looking to better understand child abuse, commiserate with her, or draw strength from it, you will gain so much from reading this story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debby&amp;#39;s book is profound and extremely emotional, and can affect the bravest of hearts. Follow her journey into finding out what living as a child of child abuse was really like growing up in the 50&amp;#39;s and 60&amp;#39;s and how there weren&amp;#39;t any real agencies that would or who could help those suffering. Follow her as she retells her story of survival....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
