  <title>The Juarez Knife - Richard Deming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lawrence Randall offers detective Manville &quot;Manny&quot; Moon a cool $1,500 for a couple days low-risk work, he should have known there would be a catch. And sure enough, there is -- enough that he should have charged double...&lt;P&gt;
Moon doesn&#39;t put up with nonsense. And once he&#39;s on a case, he won&#39;t stop until he sees it through to the end. Never mind that he only has one leg (lost in the second World War...it&#39;s 1948). He always gets his man. Or his woman.&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Manville &#39;Manny&#39; Moon is one of the great unknown series eyes that somehow slipped through the cracks. He&#39;s tough, honest and handy with the wisecracks, but he&#39;s a whole lot more. He&#39;s pulp, through and through, but he also displays a compassionate side that neatly echoes or anticipates Lew Archer, Dan Fortune et al.&quot; -- thrillingdetective.com" />
