  <title>The Queen of Bright and Shiny Things, Chapters 1-5 - Ann Aguirre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sage Czinski is trying really hard to be perfect. If she manages it, people won&#39;t peer beyond the surface, or ask hard questions about her past. She&#39;s learned to substitute causes for relationships, and it&#39;s working just fine. . . until Shane Cavendish strolls into her math class. He&#39;s a little antisocial, a lot beautiful, and everything she never knew she always wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane Cavendish just wants to be left alone to play guitar and work on his music. He&#39;s got heartbreak and loneliness in his rearview mirror, and this new school represents his last chance. He doesn&#39;t expect to be happy; he only wants to graduate and move on. He never counted on a girl like Sage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But love doesn&#39;t mend all broken things, and sometimes life has to fall apart before it can be put back together again. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
