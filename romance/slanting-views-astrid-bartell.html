  <title>Slanting Views - Astrid Bartell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clashing encounters around a mysterious object, 
A high school dropout, a tourist, 
Love, magic, death, lust. 
Another mere summer romance? 
Far from it. 
So far in fact that Ann, Melchior and the locals of an otherwise quiet South Carolina community will all be compelled to deal with a most intricate network of massive revelations escaped from the hands of Time. 
Melchior, this is nonsensical! 
Melchior nodded lightly and went on: Well, yes, but no. This is weird, almost alien, you know, and there youre right, it is nonsensical. You sure you want me to tell you what I think? 
Most definitely. 
Well, its worse than that. Its not what I think but what I know. For a fact. Four facts so far. Are you sure you want me to tell you? 
I am ready to face whatever it is you are about to reveal to me. 
Okay, here goes. What you got from it is not what I got from it. And dont ask me if Im sure. Im not sure, I know. It adapts. I have proof. 
Let the multiple worlds of Slanting Views sweep you off your daily routines. 
Enter Slanting Views and Bon Voyage to You!" />
