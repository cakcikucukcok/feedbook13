  <title>Be Who You Want to Be - Leon J. Boone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Be Who You Want to Be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of struggling with being African Americans in the greatest country on earth, the United States of America, we are still not equal. As a preacher, I preach to tell the common people that there is hope in this country. There is no pure race in our country. This world doesnt belong to any one civilization. The world is smaller than ever before. We need to respect one another and allow God to help us have confidence in one another. We need the vision to acknowledge the rights of all people. The grievances we have with one another are racial and large social groups discrimination, and we must face it. We must encourage self-esteem for all people. When you dont know who you are, you cant be who you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that we can profit a lot by being cautious. Dont turn your life over to someone else for his or her approval. Respect yourself. I want to encourage people to believe in their dreams. In order to make your dreams come true, you must believe in yourself. I want you to know that people on top of the world do get slapped in the face by lifes disappointments. There is help if we have an attitude of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of what you share with other people. Some people are superstars only in their own minds. These people live on the edge of life.. Bullying comes in different forms. This mysterious behavior that comes from other people will stop you from making smart choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person goes through a change in his or her life. But failure could be a step forward in your life. If your plan has failed you, use your disadvantage to your advantage. Our enemy walks with us daily. The only remedy for an emotional heart ache is your faith in God. Faith is holding on one day longer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
