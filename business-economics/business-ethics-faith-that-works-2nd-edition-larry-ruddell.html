  <title>Business Ethics – Faith That Works, 2Nd Edition - Larry Ruddell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Business EthicsFaith That Works, 2nd Edition shows how faith forms the foundation for the theory and practice of business ethics and how ethical leadership results in long-term success in business. It challenges readers to understand their own beliefs and actively base the ethics they practice in business on those beliefs for building an ethical culture that can lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins by covering business ethics basics, highlighting how ethics are good for business. Ruddell then analyses the Scriptural teaching about business ethics as a model for how faith can (and indeed must) integrate with business ethics and then contrasts with other, secular, views of business ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues by reviewing steps for solving ethical problems in business and how to set up and carry out an effective ethics program inside the business and how companies can extend those ethics to those around them through effective social outreach programs, and to the environment by being good stewards of our resources.&lt;/p&gt;" />
