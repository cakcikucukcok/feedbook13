  <title>Meditations for a Quiet Place - Benson Ebinne (M.S. M.Div.)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meditations for a Quiet Place aims to present two goals that become apparent as the book progresses. First is the exposure to scriptural references; followed by thoughtful analysis. The authors approach to scripture interpretation involves attention to textual connections that make the Word of God interesting. He believes that a devotional should go beyond the superficial treatment of isolated texts that in some cases does not address the context of surrounding verses. He admires the writings of Biblical authors like: Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Luke. John and Paul. These and other authors in the Bible have written thought provoking, inspirational, wise and good for all times material that deserves our close attention. They present the attributes of the God who is loving, compassionate, just, trustworthy and righteous. This God desires to be with His people, and be known by them. He is the source of wisdom that is made readily available for those who ask for it. Wisdom is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding (Proverbs 4:7, NKJV). Meditation on scripture is a spiritual exercise that is recommended by the Lord Himself, as can be seen in Joshua 1:8 and Psalm 1:1-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two references assure the believer of divine guidance, stability, success and prosperity. The epitome of divine guidance, stability, success and prosperity, is Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah of God. His obedience kept him focussed on the goal before him; and having accomplished it, is seated at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:12).&lt;/p&gt;" />
