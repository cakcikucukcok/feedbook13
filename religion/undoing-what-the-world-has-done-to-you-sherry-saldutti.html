  <title>Undoing What the World Has Done to You - Sherry Saldutti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a road every woman must travel in order to truly discover who she is in the Lord. We are all buried beneath voices of what people have told us about ourselves, messages telling us who and what we should be. The world does many things to our minds, our hearts, our souls. This Bible study is a process of how to begin to undo all of the things the world has done to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take a look at the foundation we stand upon. Is it made from man, or have you built it on the Word of God? We get exhausted trying so hard to fit into a world that is not of the Kingdom of God and then wonder why we dont feel him in our presence. Ladies, you must undo and get out of the things you are buried beneath to discover the real truth. That you, my dear, are a beautiful daughter of a King created with great purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us begin to undo so we can DO His will!&lt;/p&gt;" />
