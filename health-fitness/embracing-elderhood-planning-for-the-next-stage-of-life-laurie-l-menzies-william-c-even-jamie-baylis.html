  <title>Embracing Elderhood: Planning for the Next Stage of Life - Laurie L Menzies, William C Even, Jamie Baylis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally! A practical guide to walk you through the process of planning for a longer life. Using her years of experience as an Elder Law and Estate Planning attorney, and the personal lessons she learned walking her own parents through this process, Laurie Menzies explains, in practical terms, the best way to plan for this stage of life. You may be asking questions like: &quot;Who will care for me?&quot;, &quot;Where will I live?&quot; and &quot;Will I have enough money?&quot; Unfortunately, many families either ignore the need for planning, only to &quot;stumble through&quot; a fragmented, confusing system that often leaves them overwhelmed and without enough information to make good choices. Most families do not have a clear picture of how their finances will be managed when they need to pay for long-term care. Nor do they have a clear understanding of the progression of care, or where to how it can be accessed. By reading this book, you will learn: • the legal documents you will use to protect and distribute your assets • how to best organize your assets to plan for long-term care costs • what are the various levels of care and how to pay for them • why every plan must consider your legal, financial and long-term care needs Finally, there is one book that can help you make sense of it all. Embracing Elderhood: Planning for the Next Stage of Life brings together the essential information in an integrated, coordinated approach to help you navigate the legal, financial and long-term care needs of your loved ones. The first and only comprehensive guide, Embracing Elderhood: Planning for the Next Stage of Life is a MUST READ for aging parents and their families!" />
