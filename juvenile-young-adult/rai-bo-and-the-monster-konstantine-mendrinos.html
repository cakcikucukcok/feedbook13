  <title>Rai, Bo and the Monster - Konstantine Mendrinos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rai, Bo and the Monster is a picture book written for young children. It is a heartwarming tale about two children who live in the clouds. They are given an extraordinary gift of making things happy through their paintings. Curiously, they do not realize that they could also create sadness. Rai loves painting peace and happiness, but Bo would rather create sadness. While painting happiness, Bo encounters a sad and angry monster who also lives in the clouds. How did the monster become so sad, and how could he be painted happy?
This is a story that is entertaining and creative. It will teach children about responsibility toward one another and whatever they may experience. By creating happiness through their own actions, lessons of forgiveness, and love for one another, the environment could be nurtured." />
