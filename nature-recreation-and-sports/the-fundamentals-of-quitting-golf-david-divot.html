  <title>The Fundamentals of Quitting Golf - David Divot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The Fundamentals of Quitting Golf&lt;/I&gt; offers permanent relief, or perhaps just a chuckle, to golf sufferers who swear they are going to quit the game, often using very colorful language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained by author David Divot, your mind is cluttered with excuses for your poor play: lack of lessons, bad courses, old clubs, new clubs and on and on. Quitting &quot;cold turkey&quot; does not work because, subconsciously, you want to believe this nonsense. But with Divot&#39;s ten-year course of treatment, you eventually admit that there is no excuse for your game.&lt;/p&gt;
Explore techniques to control your anger and depression. Then ponder why you would put that monumental achievement at risk by trying to golf.
Discover that having confidence in your game is the surest way to shatter your confidence.
Consider why golf magazines constantly offer new tips for curing the same problems that were supposedly cured by the tips offered in previous issues.
Find out how to heighten your disappointment by pretending you have some control over where your ball will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not cure your golf affliction with &lt;I&gt;The Fundamentals of Quitting Golf&lt;/I&gt;, but at least you&#39;ll have a good laugh trying.&lt;/p&gt;" />
