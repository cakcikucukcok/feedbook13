  <title>Birds Chasing Hope - Dr. Ashish Modi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a group of angry foreign birds demand that Maya and her friends participate in their evil plots of revenge and destruction against humans by exploiting their weaknesses, Maya and her friends quickly realize that if they dont think of an alternative plan, the entire world will be destroyed.
Maya and her friends utilize their lifelong experiences to come up with an alternative plan by learning from humans strength and ingenuity. With that, they not only convince foreign birds but also the entire animal kingdom to participate in their new vision. Thus, together they not only save their forest, but also the world.
This is a hopeful and inspirational tale of a group of birds and animals who- despite all the odds against them- overcome their agony and sorrow. They not only save their forest and habitat, but also assist humans in their struggles to protect the environment and save the planet from more destruction.
This novel is a metaphor that discusses our past, present and future in an easy to understand language as seen through birds&#39; perspective.
If you enjoyed The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho or Life of Pi by Yann Martel, you will certainly love this book. If you cherished The Lion King or Finding Nemo, you will love this book as well." />
