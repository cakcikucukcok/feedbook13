  <title>Obama 2012 - Jacques P. Ferraris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Using any lies to demonize Obama, the conservative crowd tries to frighten the&lt;br&gt;American people by accusing him of promoting CLASS WARFARE. During his&lt;br&gt;inspiring State of the Union, the President clearly stated that he and Democrats&lt;br&gt;are not at all against financial success. On the contrary, we admire success AS&lt;br&gt;LONG AS IT IS OBTAINED HONESTLY. What we demand is a tax code revision so&lt;br&gt;that those, like Romney, who make millions annually from &#39;investments&#39; will no&lt;br&gt;longer get taxed at a lower rate than Americans who must work for a living. Mr.&lt;br&gt;Romney only paid 13.9% on 40 + millions. If a group is promoting class warfare,&lt;br&gt;it is not the 99%; it is the 1% who successfully lobbied the GOP to lower the tax&lt;br&gt;rate on &#39;Investment/Capital Gain Incomes&#39; to 15%. NOW THE GOP WANTS TO&lt;br&gt;LOWER THE RATE EVEN MORE! It is so repugnant that America&#39;s 2 richest men,&lt;br&gt;Bill Gates and Warren Buffet declared publicly that they should pay more taxes!&lt;br&gt;WB even cited his secretary who pays a higher tax rate on her &#39;EARNED INCOME&#39;&lt;br&gt;$60,000 SALARY than WB&#39;s rate on his INVESTMENT INCOME of several millions.&lt;br&gt;Requesting an end to this scandal has nothing to do with Class Warfare. &#39;OBAMA&lt;br&gt;2012 lists all sorts of GOP outrageous lies and schemes to vilify President Obama.&lt;br&gt;The last chapter &#39;How Swede it is&#39; shows how rational and compassionate politics&lt;br&gt;have transformed a previously poor country into a prosperous industrial giant&lt;br&gt;where people are totally free to succeed in business but cannot abuse anybody" />
