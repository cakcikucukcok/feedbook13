  <title>Hilda - Carol M. H. Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Carol Roth was in her late thirties living a hectic, programmed life as wife, mother, real estate agent, volunteer, and tennis player. She believed she was pursuing and experiencing the life of her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spring of 1998, Carol was diagnosed with leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2010, after managing her dis-ease for over 12 years, she arrived at an impasse. The leukemia had mutated, transforming into an aggressively growing, chemotherapy-resistant disease, leaving her with only one alternative: a bone marrow transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a year after the transplant passed without significant improvement, and Carol and her family faced the potential possibility of hospice care as the next step in her health journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, today, she is medication-free, cancer-free, and savoring fully the joys of life without a Health Imbalance, Leukemia Diagnosis Adventure, a term she references in her book as an elephant named Hilda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carols healing adventure is an empowering story of transformation, courage, and learning. Discover how Carol embraces her health challenge as the impetus to begin a life-changing spiritual journey; how she creates HILDA , an unusual relationship to her experience; how she and her support team navigate the physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental nuances of living with complications; and how her adventure ultimately leads her to an integration of body, mind, and spirit, uncovering balanced health and the joy filled blessing of a beginning again attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True healing can manifest in many different ways. A truth common to all of us, according to Carol&#39;s experience, is that when we choose to live in alignment with spiritual guidance, miracles happen. When we live the questions of What can I learn? How can I love? and What is for the highest good? anything is possible, and everything always gets better.&lt;/p&gt;
