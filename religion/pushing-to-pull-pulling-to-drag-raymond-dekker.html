  <title>Pushing to Pull? Pulling to Drag? - Raymond Dekker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you struggling with marital situations that have a significant impact on your money management? This book will give you the biblical steps on how to correct not only problems with money differences, but with almost all marital conflicts. Jesus wants to be your foundation, and he will be if you allow him. I tell the story of making changes of myself for my wife to change by using biblical leadership to draw her closer to me. I used the Bible to direct my actions to achieve unity by coming up with a plan to help us work better with money together. My plan worked perfectly, and because it worked so well, we now live an entirely different life together financially as God intended us to. The series of steps I put together will guide you into how to make those changes so you too can enjoy the benefits that we have now by living the true Christian life. Take the journey of how I accomplished this challenging mission on working together and create your own memory lane with a Christian marriage. You will not be disappointed with the results you will get when focusing on changing you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is so good!&lt;/p&gt;" />
