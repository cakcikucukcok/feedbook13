  <title>The Helpmate - Gwendolyn O. Hinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The HelpMate is a book that can assist you in the trials of your marriage.  Most of us are always looking for a way to support or end our marriages.  The author has written this book in faith hoping that it will be advice to those who are seeking refuge for their marriage.  Also, the book describes the role of The HelpMate so that we can understand what position we uphold in our marriages as women who are wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts and friends.  The book is an easy read and can possibly be helpful to you in sustaining your marriage.  Whether your marriage is in the beginning, struggling or attempting to survive, The HelpMate can help.  If youre seeking encouragement for your marriage The HelpMate is a wonderful motivating tool that you can benefit from.  
A lot of the authors life in a long-term marriage has been disclosed through various trials and tribulations in her own marriage.  The disclosure is to serve as a weapon to help husbands and wives recognize where they may need help to survive in a marriage that they both want.  As the author of this book I dont believe that we should wait until the marriage is at a dead end and then try and look for the help, but look for help when the life of the marriage is in the beginning or surviving stage so that you will never have to worry about your end being a dead one.  Read the HelpMate and be open and receptive for life changing words that may fulfill your palate, knowing that others go through similar struggles in an attempt to keep a good and strong marriage.  Remember to become selfless because when we marry 2 Shall Become 1 and only God can explain to us what it means, but we have to be able and willing to walk in our roles with love.  Be Blessed and May Grace and Peace Abound With You as You Expose Yourself to The HelpMate." />
