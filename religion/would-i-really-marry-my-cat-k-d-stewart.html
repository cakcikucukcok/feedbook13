  <title>Would I Really Marry My Cat?! - K.D. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Could it be that our delusions of the perfect life expose disillusion with our perfect God? K.D. Stewart poses that and other thought-provoking questions in &lt;i&gt;Would I Really Marry My Cat?!&lt;/i&gt;a fresh and compelling look at trusting God when His sovereignty confronts our self-focused ambition, hopes, and hurts. A raw and sometimes ridiculous exploration of faith, &lt;i&gt;Would I Really Marry My Cat?!&lt;/i&gt; probes this simple yet profound truth: Life as a Christ-follower is not always a charmed life. It is a strategically-designed, intentionally-lived testimony of Gods trustworthiness regardless of ones circumstances. &lt;p&gt;
       K.D. long dreamed of becoming a wife and a mom. One night her prince finally came. He looked at her with kind, devoted eyes and said, Marry me. And she gleefully accepted his proposaleven though she knew he was a cat! It was easy for her to look past the whiskers and the tail. What mattered most was, for the first time in a long time, she experienced satisfaction deep within her heart. Then K.D. woke up  and the morning light exposed something dark deep within her souldisappointment in God and discontentment with the life He had given her. Out of this season of struggle, K.D. has drawn a series of stories, reflections, and prayers that will encourage, challenge, and inspire you to find joy-filled confidence in the God who created you and the life He has given you, even when it looks nothing like the life of your dreams." />
