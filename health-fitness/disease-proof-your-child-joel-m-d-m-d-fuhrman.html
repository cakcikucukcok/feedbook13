  <title>Disease-Proof Your Child - Joel M.D. M.D. Fuhrman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Disease-Proof Your Child &lt;/i&gt;features easy-to-prepare, kid-friendly recipes that will satisfy even the pickiest eaters, and will help your whole family establish life-long healthful eating habits.    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harness the power of a nutrient-rich diet to ensure a lifetime free of illness and full of health!  &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his private practice, Joel Fuhrman, M.D. helps families transform their eating habits and recover their health. His nutrient-rich eating plan can have a significant impact on your child&#39;s resistance to dangerous infections, and a dramatic effect on reducing the occurrence of illnesses like asthma, ear infections, and allergies. Dr. Fuhrman explains how you can make sure your children are eating right to maintain a healthy mind and body, and how eating certain foods and avoiding others can positively impact your child&#39;s IQ and success in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also presents the fascinating science that demonstrates that the current epidemic of adult cancers and other diseases is closely linked to what we eat in the first quarter of life. Eating well in our early years may enable us to win the war on cancer. Bolstered by this scientific evidence, he helps you do everything you can to protect your child against developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and cancer through a solid nutritional groundwork.&lt;/p&gt;" />
