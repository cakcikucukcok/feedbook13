  <title>Out of Nowhere - Marcus M. Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The musical life of Warne Marsh, perhaps the most improviser of the history of music in the west. It is his life as he might have told it. His song is set to words.&lt;/p&gt;
Some comments about this book by musicians, music lovers and writers:&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;The most literate book about jazz-or any music-that I have read. A compelling read-as soon as I reached the last page I had to start all over again.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Kerr Ferguson (UK)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;A wonderful study of a musician and a human being. It deserves to be published.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Jim Heymann (USA)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Just magic. Fabulous. And it would make a wonderful film.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Ike Isaacs, jazz guitarist and teacher (Australia)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;It was just like listening to Warne&#39;s music, written the way he played. Reading it made me feel like playing and playing. Thank you so much.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Susan Chen, pianist (USA)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;I started reading the book all over again and read it in one sitting, stopping only for a bite for lunch. It is an impressive book, stylish, mellifluous, deep and full of the feel of Warne&#39;s life   the feel and structure and flow of a piece of music.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Enver Carim, writer (UK)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;  the novel, is as demanding, intriguing, artistic and powerful as the best of Warne Marsh&#39;s oeuvre. This is literature of a higher order, and it swings.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Prof. Kevin Monahan, Hokuriku University (Japan)&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;  a fascinating and thoughtfully detailed insight into the life of this highly respected player. Essential reading for anyone interested in discovering the inner motivation of a jazz musician.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
