  <title>The Maestro and Marianne - Robert duRosier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 
In Robert duRosier&#39;s memoir The Maestro and Marianne, the author embarks on
a journey to uncover his true heritage.  Raised in foster care as Bobby Bannister,
and unaware of any family ties, Robert&#39;s quest is fulfilled in a way he couldn&#39;t have
imagined as he not only uncovers a racial identity he didn&#39;t know he had, but
also discovers that his father is the world-renowned Haitian musician and intellectual,
Guy duRosier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once a coming-of-age story, Maestro is also a tale of great love torn apart by cruel racial prejudice, and then brought full circle by young duRosier&#39;s searching  only to 
be shattered again in heartbreaking tragedy.  What starts as a hunt for his past, sends 
the author far beyond, on a journey to find his own greatest self.  DuRosier&#39;s writing 
sparkles with honesty and an eloquent simplicity that will have his readers cheering 
with hope and crying with loss as they follow Bobby Bannister on his journey to 
embracing his rightful heritage as Robert DuRosier.  Maestro is a story full of grace,
destined to reside in the hearts of its readers for years to come.
