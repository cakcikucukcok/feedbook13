  <title>Will You Hear It? - Savannah Alan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As an employee of the U.S. Government for many years, I sometimes tend to regard classified information as simply normal everyday work. But when I saw something that is clearly Bible prophecy being played out right before my very eyes, it definitely got my attention.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often God positions us in specific places at specific times so He can reveal things to us. Will You Hear It contains specific information He revealed to me, and requires that I share it with you. I asked God to clearly show me exactly what He wants me to do with this vital information and then turned to His Word for guidance. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever watched a good movie for the second time and saw something remarkable you missed the first time? Thats how it is with Gods Word, and I believe there is a reason for that. God points things out to you at exactly the right time for you to use them. You will do well to obey and follow the path He is laying out for you.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this writing with the intentions of sharing it only with my family and a few close friends. I gave it to those I felt led to and thought, Okay, I did what God wanted me to do. They can either believe me or ridicule me for it. But its done.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasnt done. God said, Give it to all who will accept it. I pray God will prepare your hearts and minds to receive this exactly as He intends.&lt;p&gt;" />
