  <title>The Professional Musician - Tony Lujan, Wendell Clay Kelly, Helen Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all love the art of music, but a professional musician must deal with the business of music. Wendells book helps you understand the highs and lows that can occur along the journey. As your experience unfolds, you expand your musical vistas, adding to your individuality, growing one step at a time without a direct awareness of this inevitable transition, taking place. This book tells it like it is, through the eyes of a truly professional gentleman, who has full knowledge of the elements needed to achieve success. 
Sammy Nestico, composer and arranger 
I have had the good fortune to preview Wendell Kelly&#39;s book entitled The Professional Musician. In the process of my review, I realized that I would be hard pressed to find a book packed with more pertinent information concerning the actual inner workings of the music business. Wendell has managed to incorporate a diverse collection of material that is not only academic in nature, but extremely practical as well. Wendell is himself an absolute top rate musician and performer whose experiences have made him an excellent candidate to write a book such as this. The breadth of knowledge between the covers will take the reader through an eclectic group of subjects ranging from practical on the job performance tips, to legal advice such as contract negotiation and copyright law. This is a book that would be a valuable asset in the university classroom or in your own home library as an on the job training manual.

For the past ten years, Wendell has devoted his time organizing information and writing about what he knows best: music. In an effort to help young and young-at-heart musicians, he has compiled valuable information that will assist them in charting the waters of musicianship. His book, The Professional Musician: The Music, the Business, the Career, the Life, is a compilation of gems of lessons learned from the best in the music industry. Wendell shows how to set goals, make contacts, set up a home office or home studio, how to navigate and survive the mental and physical challenges of a traveling musician. In addition, he discusses relationships, finances, travel tips, composing and arranging music, and copyright issues. Wendell also gives a brief synopsis of recording conglomerations with a wonderful tribute to well-known and not-so-well-known musicians, vocalists and backup singers. Included in his book is a brief history and contributions of Unions, particularly as they relate to the music industry. If you have a budding musician or well-established musician in the family, this book will make a treasured gift for years to come. I heartily recommend this book!
