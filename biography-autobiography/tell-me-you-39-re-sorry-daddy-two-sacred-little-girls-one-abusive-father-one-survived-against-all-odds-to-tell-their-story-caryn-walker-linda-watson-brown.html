  <title>Tell Me You&#39;re Sorry, Daddy - Two Sacred Little Girls. One Abusive Father. One Survived Against All Odds to Tell Their Story - Caryn Walker, Linda Watson-Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tell Me You&#39;re Sorry, Daddy&lt;/i&gt; is the moving true story of one man&#39;s horrific campaign of abuse against his own daughter, which continued for more than seven years of her childhood, and has had effects which continue to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;32 years after the abuse began, Caryn Walker finally saw her father in court in 2011, charged with 24 counts of abuse against her.  As she awaited the verdict, she looked at the man who robbed her of so many years, who never showed any remorse, and realised that she was the one who was strong, she was the survivor.  Caryn knew that it was time for her to tell her full story - and that of her dead sister, Jennifer. Against all the odds, she fought.  And she won.&lt;/p&gt;" />
