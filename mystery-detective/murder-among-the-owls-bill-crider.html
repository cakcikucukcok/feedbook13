  <title>Murder Among the OWLS - Bill Crider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was the cat who &quot;told&quot; Sheriff Dan Rhodes that something was wrong. It ran into the house when he opened the door. His wife, Ivy, recognized the cat as belonging to their neighbor and told Dan to go check on the widow--Helen Harris never let the cat out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dan finds Helen&#39;s body on her kitchen floor, there is nothing to indicate that her death wasn&#39;t an accident. But Ivy&#39;s words ring in his head. Why was the cat out? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen had been active in a number of women&#39;s groups, one of which was the OWLS, the Older Women&#39;s Literary Society. She and some other women would also venture out with digging tools to look for ancient booty in the lands around the town. They didn&#39;t usually find much, but every now and then someone would dig up a coin or a piece of jewelry with potential. Could this have been the reason for Helen&#39;s death?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation becomes more complicated as Rhodes learns that she actually had a number of suitors. Also, a news-hungry reporter who smells a juicy story gives Rhodes more trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the fourteenth book in which Bill Crider has wowed readers with the extraordinary adventures of his Sheriff Dan Rhodes. Add a cast of vibrant characters, including wise-cracking deputies and the slightly wacky local citizens in Rhodes&#39;s bailiwick, and every book in this series is a wonderful treat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
