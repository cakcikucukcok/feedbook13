  <title>Two Week Turnaround - Geneva Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Give Sofia King two weeks and she can turn any strung out star’s career and life around. She’s got it all—the career, the shoes, the glamour—and her plans don’t include a man unless he comes with a guaranteed toe-curling orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when her father, head of Maxximum Studios, calls in a favor, she’s forced to take on the one bad boy she has no interest in reforming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Isaac Blue.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With box-office bankability and a new woman in his bed every night, Isaac seems to have it all. Except happiness. So when his latest antics threaten to shut down a summer blockbuster and his producers decide to send in Sofia King, Isaac may have a shot at getting what he really wants. The one woman who got away. Sofia’s icy attitude about their past only makes him want to turn up the heat. And Isaac isn&#39;t about to say no to Sofia&#39;s proposed plan of action, especially if it gets her back in his bed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sofia is sure a week with Isaac will get him out of her system and keep him in line until filming is over.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But as on-set supervision becomes in-trailer flirtation, and wild sex turns into sensual lovemaking, Sofia might just be the one whose life is turning around…&lt;/p&gt;
