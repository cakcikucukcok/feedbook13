  <title>A Son of Life - Don De La Don</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a journey into one, who is a gifted son of light. He was born unto life and became man. Saint John and Aaron take us on their journey into the pits of Hell. After befriending and earning the love of the Devil, the hierarchys of Hell delve upon them while Aaron deals in and out of the methamphetamine trade. Earning the respect of all the Princes and Dukes of Hell, after beating their King Satan at his own game, Aaron becomes the Saint of the Streets. After seeing himself in a trance, Aaron earned a new name as Saint John the Immaculate, and takes on a new role, as a possible clandestine agent for the CIA. After filling out an application for a field analysts position in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he receives a callback, in the spirit. From then on, its a fight to the End, as all of Hells Army comes against them and America. Aaron later finds their defense network and internet forum which may have been dubbed, Operation Myspace. When Aaron finds a small weapon of mass destruction in the flesh, he begins to lose his mind as to what he saw and what he experienced. Was it all a possible apocalypse? Or was it a reindeer game that intelligence officials play with one another? There is a lot more to the story at hand, and will come to light in future works. What Aaron experienced was very real to him, as he heard and seen it both in the spirit and in the flesh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After growing up on the mean streets of Albuquerque and Southern California, Aaron was chosen not only by One, but by many others. From gangsters and syndicates, to devils and Christians. Even the Intelligence community sought after him. For everyone observed what happened in the spirit and now this story must be told. This is the story of Aaron and the Triune of Saint John the Immaculate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
