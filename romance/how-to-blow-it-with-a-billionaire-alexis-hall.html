  <title>How to Blow It with a Billionaire - Alexis Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Be careful what you wish for . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Once upon a time there was a totally ordinary boy who fell for a cold, beautiful prince. Only it&#39;s not a fairy tale, it&#39;s my life. The prince is a billionaire called Caspian Hart. And we&#39;re trying super hard to live happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;He&#39;s everything I want, need, and can&#39;t resist: a man who looks like a god and bangs like the devil. Except he&#39;s still got his rules and he&#39;s still got his secrets . . .&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;But if there&#39;s one thing Caspian&#39;s taught me it&#39;s that you should never settle for less than you&#39;re worth. And I&#39;m worth his trust. I have to show him that I see him. That I&#39;m not afraid of his passion, or his power, or his past. And that I won&#39;t settle for less than everything.&lt;br&gt;" />
