  <title>Forever and a Day (The Inn at Sunset Harbor—Book 5) - Sophie Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Sophie Love&#39;s ability to impart magic to her readers is exquisitely wrought in powerfully evocative phrases and descriptions….This is the perfect romance or beach read, with a difference: its enthusiasm and beautiful descriptions offer an unexpected attention to the complexity of not just evolving love, but evolving psyches. It&#39;s a delightful recommendation for romance readers looking for a touch more complexity from their romance reads.”&lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review (Diane Donovan re For Now and Forever)&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FOREVER AND A DAY is book #5 in the bestselling romance series The Inn at Sunset Harbor, which begins with book #1, For Now and Forever—a free download!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;35 year old Emily Mitchell has fled her job, apartment and ex-boyfriend in New York City for her father&#39;s historic, abandoned home on the coast of Maine, needing a change in her life and determined to make it work as a B&amp;B. She had never expected, though, that her relationship with its caretaker, Daniel, would turn her life on its head.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FOREVER AND A DAY, Emily is stunned to finally, after 20 years, meet her missing father—just a week before her wedding. Their reunion changes both of their lives, and unlocks the key to the house’s many secrets, and to Emily’s missing memories.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring has finally arrived at Sunset Harbor, and with just a week to go until the big wedding date, the wedding preparations are busier than ever, including Daniel’s surprise talk of a honeymoon. Will Emily and Daniel have their dream wedding? Or will someone appear to tear it apart?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Chantelle’s custody battle comes to a pitch, and as Memorial Day looms, they must figure out what to do with Trevor’s house. Yet amidst all of this, another issue weighs most heavily on Emily’s mind: will she herself ever be pregnant?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOREVER AND A DAY is book #5 in a dazzling new romance series that will make you laugh, cry, keep you turning pages late into the night—and make you fall in love with romance all over again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #6 will be available soon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very well written novel, describing the struggle of a woman (Emily) to find her true identity. The author did an amazing job with the creation of the characters and her description of the environment. The romance is there, but not overdosed. Kudos to the author for this amazing start of a series that promises to be very entertaining.”&lt;p&gt;--Books and Movies Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re For Now and Forever)" />
