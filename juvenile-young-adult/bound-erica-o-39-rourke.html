  <title>Bound - Erica O&#39;Rourke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I beat you. Twice. No magic, and I still beat you. And that was when I didn&#39;t know what I was doing.   I smiled, cold as the winter sky outside. &quot;Imagine what I&#39;m capable of now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mo Fitzgerald has made her choice: A life in Chicago. A future with Colin. To leave behind the enigmatic Luc and the world of the Arcs. But every decision she&#39;s made, from avenging her best friend&#39;s death to protecting the people she loves, has come at a terrible price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her father returns from prison and the Seraphim regroup, war breaks out in both her worlds. And Mo isn&#39;t the only one with secrets to hide and choices to make. The more she struggles to keep her magic and mortal lives separate, the deadlier the consequences. In the end, Mo must risk everything &amp;#8211; her life, her heart, her future--or lose it all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Erica O&#39;Rourke&#39;s Torn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;O&#39;Rourke&#39;s heroine is refreshing: determined, spunky, and unpredictable.&quot;  &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fast-paced action, a mysterious underworld and a dark, exciting quest for vengeance. O&#39;Rourke had me hanging on every word.&quot;  &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A beautifully written dramatic story of loss, destiny, sacrifice, and love.&quot;   &amp;#8211;SciFiChick.com" />
