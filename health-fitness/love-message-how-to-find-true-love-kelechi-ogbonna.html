  <title>love message how to find true love - kelechi ogbonna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;If love steals life, you have no choice,&amp;quot; said an old man sitting on the corner of a street. I noticed these words when an old man whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The old man seemed strangely affected. By nature, he looked like an old trace of a forbidden family. His long, scattered hair showed the lack of thoughtful hands around him, and his covering material revealed the extinction of the people around him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I approached him and apologized to my friends who were joking and laughing. I went to see the elderly person and asked; &amp;quot;Around the world, human development has changed? I don&amp;#39;t want to be disrespectful, but I am revealing the truth and it is my art and my profession.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot; The old man was not touched by my words and continued to mumble. over and over again, but maybe he was lost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I put my hand on his shoulder. He looked up and looked deep into my eyes, then lowered his head. I was surprised by this strange behaviour, but I asked with curiosity: &amp;quot;Oh, old man, speak! &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;Because the force in you cannot resist silence.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The old man replied, &amp;quot;Do you have ears to listen or accept and believe?&amp;quot; It was a rather unusual question, but I nodded my head positively. Then he said, &amp;quot;The days when colours carried their meaning and the songs of my soul escaped; I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;
