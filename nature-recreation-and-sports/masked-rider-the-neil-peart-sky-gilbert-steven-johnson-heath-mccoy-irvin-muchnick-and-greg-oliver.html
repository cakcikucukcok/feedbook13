  <title>Masked Rider, The - Neil Peart, Sky Gilbert, Steven Johnson, Heath McCoy, Irvin Muchnick and Greg Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neil Peart&#39;s travel memoir of thoughts, observations, and experiences as he cycles through West Africa, reveals the subtle, yet powerful writing style that has made him one of rock&#39;s greatest lyricists. As he describes his extraordinary journey and his experiences - from the pains of dysentery, to a confrontation with an armed soldier, to navigating dirt roads off the beaten path - he reveals his own emotional landscape, and along the way, the different &quot;masks&quot; that he discovers he wears.
&quot;Cycling is a good way to travel anywhere, but especially in Africa. You are independent and mobile, and yet travel at people speed - fast enough to travel on to another town in the cooler morning hours, but slow enough to meet people: the old farmer at the roadside who raises his hand and says, &#39;You are welcome,&#39; the tireless women who offer a smile to a passing cyclist, the children whose laughter transcends the humblest home.&quot;" />
