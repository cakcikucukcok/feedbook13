  <title>Dancing Outside the Box - Beth Valentine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Beths mother loved to tell this story.&lt;/br&gt;
One morning when Beth was three or four years old,&lt;/br&gt; 
she stepped out onto their front porch wearing coveralls.&lt;/br&gt; 
A man approached on the sidewalk. Seeing her&lt;/br&gt;
he called out, Hello, little boy.&lt;/br&gt;
I am not a boy, Beth called back. Im a girl.&lt;/br&gt;
Little girls dont wear coveralls, he informed her.&lt;/br&gt;
This girl does, she informed him.&lt;/br&gt;
That little girl, supremely indifferent to popular opinion,&lt;/br&gt;
determined to think for herself and set her own rules,&lt;/br&gt;
has stayed alive in this author throughout her long,&lt;/br&gt;
very healthy and happy life.&lt;/br&gt;
This is a book of ideas. The author tells of incidents&lt;/br&gt;
in her own life and in the lives of family members&lt;/br&gt;
and friends to illustrate these ideas. In mid-life she slowly&lt;/br&gt;
changed from what is considered logical, critical, left brain&lt;/br&gt;
thinking to emotional, illogical, right brain thinking,&lt;/br&gt;
dismantling her left brain beliefs brick by brick and replacing them&lt;/br&gt;
with what many in the western world would consider weird nonsense.&lt;/br&gt; 
She developed psychic powers, was repeatedly amazed at the power&lt;/br&gt;
and range of human consciousness and began to live in a bright&lt;/br&gt;
new world filled with surprises and certainties, a magical,&lt;/br&gt;
wonder-filled world.&lt;/center&gt;" />
