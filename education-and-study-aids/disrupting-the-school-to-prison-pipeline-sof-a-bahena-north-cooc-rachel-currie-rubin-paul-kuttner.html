  <title>Disrupting the School-to-Prison Pipeline - Sofía Bahena, North Cooc, Rachel Currie-Rubin, Paul Kuttner...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;A trenchant and wide-ranging look at this alarming national trend, &lt;I&gt;Disrupting the School-to-Prison Pipeline&lt;/I&gt; is unsparing in its account of the problem while pointing in the direction of meaningful and much-needed reforms.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; The &amp;ldquo;school-to-prison pipeline&amp;rdquo; has received much attention in the education world over the past few years. A fast-growing and disturbing development, it describes a range of circumstances whereby &amp;ldquo;children are funneled out of public schools and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems.&amp;rdquo; Scholars, educators, parents, students, and organizers across the country have pointed to this shocking trend, insisting that it be identified and understood&amp;mdash;and that it be addressed as an urgent matter by the larger community.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; This new volume from the &lt;I&gt;Harvard Educational Review &lt;/I&gt;features essays from scholars, educators, students, and community activists who are working to disrupt, reverse, and redirect the pipeline. Alongside these authors are contributions from the people most affected: youth and adults who have been incarcerated, or whose lives have been shaped by the school-to-prison pipeline. Through stories, essays, and poems, these individuals add to the book&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive portrait of how our education and justice systems function&amp;mdash;and how they fail to serve the interests of many young people.&amp;quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
