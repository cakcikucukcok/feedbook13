He heads The Melbourne Environment Centre, which locks horns with the Company. This battle spills over into the Philippines, where HMC is launching a new mining operation after uncovering the largest copper deposit in Asia.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a political pragmatist who campaigns on climate change and sustainable development, Tom becomes enmeshed in a network of green militant insurgents who see him and his campaign as part of the problem.
