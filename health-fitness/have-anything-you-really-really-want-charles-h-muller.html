  <title>Have Anything You Really Really Want! - Charles H. Muller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have Anything You Really Really Want!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a thought-provoking study about the power of positive thinking and the Christian faith.&lt;p&gt;It follows the authors own personal journey of faith and discovery as he details how his Christian faith unleashed a positive powerin the attainment of personal, even material goals (including the acquisition of university degrees and a Rolls Royce!), but more significantly in the realisation of far-reaching goals: the discovery of his wife and ultimately the transition from university professor in South Africa to successful hotel-owner in Scotland.&lt;p&gt;An important lesson in the experience of mid-life change is seen in the close dependence on Gods love and boundless supply for all needs, material and spiritual.&lt;p&gt;From establishing an objective, working out a strategy, and using faith and initiative, this detailed thesis explores the essential principles for personal success and achievement and guides the reader step-by-step through the practical process of attaining his or her goals.&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, however, it asks whether it is the individual, or the invisible hand of Providence, which engineers the successeven to the extent of changing ones original goals, and changing oneself in the process." />
