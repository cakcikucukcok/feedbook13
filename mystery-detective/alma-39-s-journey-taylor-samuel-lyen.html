  <title>Alma&#39;s Journey - Taylor Samuel Lyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hauntingly beautiful account of how women understand their purpose in life and use their power to transform humankind . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In twenty-first century America, in a remote town nestled in the Sierra mountain forests, Alma Whitman lives secluded with her brother Edgar and with Fenway, Edgars golden retriever. Alma has never set foot in a church and draws her spiritual strength from the wilderness. She forges emotional and spiritual connections within a community of women called the Sisterhood. Within the community of sisters Alma seeks close relationships with Florence de la Rosa, Dr. Silvia Preston and Desiree Parker, whom she senses will strengthen, guide, and carry forward the work of the Sisterhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Sunday Reverend Henry rushes to the Whitman cabin for his weekly chess game. Edgar and Henry grapple in the heat of mock battle, while Alma prepares lunch for her boys. Henry is an established minister of the cross. He holds great sway in the community of Abbeville, most of which attend his house of worship, Damascus Church. That is until Fredrika Handleys gossip mill links Reverend Henry to Anne Dean, the church secretary and wife of one of the church elders. Soon whispers are heard around town about Reverend Henry and other female members of his church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alma, who is almost four decades Reverend Henrys senior, reaches out to Henry, town gossip ignites and an all out battle for the streets of Abbeville begins. Reverend Henry resigns his position as Pastor of Damascus Church. Fredrika and her gossip mill paint Alma and the Sisterhood as forest enchantresses. Abbeville slips under the control of Reverend Jacob, who renames Henrys church, the Damascus Reformed Church. And, Abbeville is literally destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
