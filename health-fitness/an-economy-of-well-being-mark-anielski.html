  <title>An Economy of Well-Being - Mark Anielski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the face of political, financial, and environmental upheaval, it&#39;s difficult to slow down and build lives of mindfulness and joy. These things are within reach, but how can we go about creating a new world, using common-sense economics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;An Economy of Well-being&lt;/em&gt;, author Mark Anielski presents a practical guide for building a new economy of well-being to help communities and nations become more flourishing and happier places to live. In this follow-up to his best-selling &lt;em&gt;The Economics of Happiness&lt;/em&gt;, Anielski addresses key questions including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can our personal and family assets be strengthened for a more fulfilling life of meaning and purpose?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can neighborhoods and cities become flourishing economies of well-being by making the best of abundant community assets?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how can an organization, a community and financial institutions measure, manage and finance assets to achieve high levels of well-being?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Economy of Well-being&lt;/em&gt; responds to a common yearning for common-sense tools to orient our lives, our businesses, and our communities towards well-being. This is ideal reading for anyone who wishes to contribute to building happier, more mindful communities, and ultimately lives of joy and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Anielski&lt;/strong&gt; is President and Chief Well-being Officer of Anielski Management Inc., and consults and speaks internationally on merging and measuring happiness, well-being, and economics. He has served as an economic advisor to Bhutan and China in their efforts to adopt new measures of well-being.
