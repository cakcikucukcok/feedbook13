  <title>Cloud Computing PaaS Platform and Storage Management Specialist Level Complete Certification Kit - Platform as a Service Study Guide Book and Online Course leading to Cloud Computing Certification Specialist - Second Edition - Ivanka Menken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Cloud computing&quot; has dramatically changed how business applications are built and run. At its core, cloud computing eliminates the costs and complexity of evaluating, buying, configuring, and managing all the hardware and software needed for enterprise applications. Instead, these applications are delivered as a service over the Internet.
&lt;p&gt;
Cloud computing has evolved to include platforms for building and running custom applications, a concept known as &quot;platform as a service&quot; (or PaaS). PaaS applications are also referred to as on-demand, Web-based, or software as a service (or SaaS) solutions.
&lt;p&gt;
Just as Amazon.com, eBay, Google, iTunes, and YouTube made it possible to access new capabilities and new markets through a Web browser, PaaS offers a faster, more cost-effective model for application development and delivery.
&lt;p&gt;
PaaS provides all the infrastructure needed to run applications over the Internet. It is delivered in the same way as a utility like electricity or water. Users simply &quot;tap in&quot; and take what they need without worrying about the complexity behind the scenes. And like a utility, PaaS is based on a metering or subscription model so users only pay for what they use.
&lt;p&gt;
With PaaS, ISVs and corporate IT departments can focus on innovation instead of complex infrastructure. By leveraging the PaaS, organizations can redirect a significant portion of their budgets from &quot;keeping the lights on&quot; to creating applications that provide real business value.
&lt;p&gt;
New to PaaS? Welcome!  If you&#39;re just starting to explore the concept of PaaS, this is the place to find out what PaaS can do for you, understand different types of PaaS solutions, and learn more about developing PaaS applications.
&lt;p&gt;
The PaaS/Storage Management Specialist level certification kit explores the concepts of Platform as a Service (SaaS) and Storage Management, and where they apply in the current technological world. In this updated second edition of the book and elearning materials, we listened to your feedback and created a more focused, specialized manual which dives straight into PaaS.
&lt;p&gt;
Using this book and the accompanying elearning materials, you will gain an understanding of the goals, objectives, benefits and challenges of the different types of PaaS and Storage Management and how they support the relevant IT Service Management processes. This certification kit will prepare you for the Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Storage Management Specialist Level Exam.
&lt;p&gt;
The pre-requisite for this program is the completion of the Cloud Computing Foundation Program.
&lt;p&gt;
This Kit contains the book and online course access that provides everything you need to prepare for the PaaS Platform and Storage Management Specialist Certification Exam, including in-depth coverage of all exam objectives, scenarios to easily demonstrate the processes in action, and practice exam questions for that last minute test preparation.
