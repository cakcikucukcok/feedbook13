With Aunt Karen taking over while Dad is away at a special school, teachers at middle school not being as understanding as Mr. Auggy, J.J. learning first-hand about bullying, and soccer becoming way more serious as she prepares for Olympic Development Program try-outs, Lucy has to depend on God more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Lucy Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Wear Pink&lt;/strong&gt; meet Lucy Rooney, a motherless tomboy with an inquisitive mind, a strong will, and a straight-forward approach, who knows every inch of the small and dusty New Mexico town in which she lives with her blind father. She is constantly searching for the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; in everything. Sometimes it helps answer her questions, and sometimes it just gets her into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;" />
