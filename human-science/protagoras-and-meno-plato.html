  <title>Protagoras and Meno - Plato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contained in this volume are two works by the great ancient Greek philosopher Plato. The &quot;Protagoras&quot;, like several of the Dialogues of Plato, is put into the mouth of Socrates, who describes a conversation which had taken place between himself and the great Sophist at the house of Callias-&#39;the man who had spent more upon the Sophists than all the rest of the world&#39;-and in which the learned Hippias and the grammarian Prodicus had also shared, as well as Alcibiades and Critias, both of whom said a few words-in the presence of a distinguished company consisting of disciples of Protagoras and of leading Athenians belonging to the Socratic circle. The dialogue commences with a request on the part of Hippocrates that Socrates would introduce him to the celebrated teacher. He has come before the dawn had risen-so fervid is his zeal. Socrates moderates his excitement and advises him to find out &#39;what Protagoras will make of him,&#39; before he becomes his pupil. The &quot;Meno&quot; begins abruptly with a question of Meno, who asks, &#39;whether virtue can be taught.&#39; Socrates replies that he does not as yet know what virtue is, and has never known anyone who did. &#39;Then he cannot have met Gorgias when he was at Athens.&#39; Yes, Socrates had met him, but he has a bad memory, and has forgotten what Gorgias said. Will Meno tell him his own notion, which is probably not very different from that of Gorgias? &#39;O yes-nothing easier: there is the virtue of a man, of a woman, of an old man, and of a child; there is a virtue of every age and state of life, all of which may be easily described.&#39; Here is presented the classic introductions and translations of Benjamin Jowett." />
