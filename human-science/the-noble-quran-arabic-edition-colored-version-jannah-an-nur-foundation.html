  <title>The Noble Quran (?????? ??????) Arabic Edition Colored Version - Jannah An-Nur Foundation</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Noble Quran (?????? ??????) Arabic Languange Edition Colored Version&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The The Noble Quran is the holy book which Muslims recite and turn to for guidance in all aspects of their life. It is the last testament in a series of divine revelations from Allah SWT (God). It comprises the unaltered and direct words of God, revealed through the Angel Gibrael, to the final Prophet Muhammad SAW some 1400 years ago. Islam is a continuation of the teachings of previous Prophets, such as Prophet Noah AS, Prophet Abraham AS, Prophet David AS, Prophet Moses AS and Prophet Jesus AS (peace be upon them all), some of whom were also given divine books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muslims believe that the key message brought by all Prophets was the same; to believe in One God (Pure Monotheism) and not to associate partners with Him, to stay away from sins and to lead a life devoted to earning Gods pleasure. All Prophets taught about life after death and gave glad tidings of paradise for those who obey God, but warned of punishment in hell for those who choose to disobey Him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Noble Quran is unique because it is the only revealed book that exists today in the precise form and content in which it was originally revealed. Furthermore, it was actively recorded during the time the religion was being established. The distinctive approach of The Noble Quran is that its spiritual message includes practical injunctions aimed at the general welfare of human beings, society and the environment in which we live. The Noble Quran message is eternal and universal, transcending our differences in race, color, ethnicity and nationality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It provides guidance on every aspect of human life, from economics and the ethics of trade to marriage, divorce, gender issues, inheritance and parenting. It neither condemns nor tortures the flesh nor does it neglect the soul. It does not humanize God, nor does it deify man. The Noble Quran describes signs of Gods existence in the universe and how everything is carefully placed in the total scheme of creation." />
