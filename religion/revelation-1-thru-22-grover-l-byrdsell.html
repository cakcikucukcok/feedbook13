  <title>Revelation 1 Thru 22 - Grover L. Byrdsell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I began to read Revelation in preparation for writing this book, I would see just how much God loves His people. I had never seen this before in my reading of Revelation.  But now as I read, I would let God open my heart for Him to give me His understanding of this amazing book of the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love of God can so easily get lost in reading the book of Revelation. But as you read Revelation youll see the love of God, the love of Jesus, and what a great God we all serve.  So I ask that you read the Holy Bible along with my book to affirm that what you read in my book is in agreement with what it says in the Holy Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that as you read Revelation you will see the Lord God and Jesus Christ have revealed all we will ever need to know about the end times.  It is also my hope that you will get a better understanding of Revelation just as it is written by Saint John the divine, the author of this wonderful book of Gods Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has more in store for all believers than we could ever think of for ourselves and it is all in the book of Revelation to read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
