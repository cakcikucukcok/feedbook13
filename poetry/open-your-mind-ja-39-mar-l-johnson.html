  <title>Open Your Mind - Ja&#39;mar L. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is Poetry at its best! Same blood, same flesh and same chemical composition. We breathe, we eat, we think and we feel. Our only difference is PRECEPTION!!! The way in which we view people, places and things based on what we know and how we feel and/or have felt. The glass can be half full and/or half empty. Growth and development comes in stages: as children, we see in black in white; as young adults, we see in black, white and grey; and as Men &amp; Women, we see the never ending various shades of colors. The more I learn, the less I realized I know. Over the years I found that it seems everyone would like things to go their way. So it started to make sense why my plans didnt always work out! Thats about the time I learned: to role with the punches in life; to make the best of everything; to always breathe easy; and what I feel is most important was the ability to lose small. My book is a lot of deep thoughts, self reflection, over years of studies. I dont believe that emotions should have the right to override intellect. The mind controls the body, so I think and I dare you to think also. The choices we make are based on what we want and/or feel we need to. Your choices are yours and they may or may not affect my life, but consequences come with all choices choose wisely. Just know that you chose conscious or not.
