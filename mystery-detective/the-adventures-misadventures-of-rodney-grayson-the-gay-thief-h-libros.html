Is it my relationship: with my cadre of friends; with my errant brother, my wayward mother and my unknown father; or with my love interest that I perceive to be selfishly pursuing his own lifelong dream without patiently and adequately considering my wants and needs? Does shared DNA define a family, or is it more a matter of our shared experiences, common values and interests? 
Since I am loyal to my brother, who I consider to be a madman, am I guilty of complicity in his crimes too? Is it right for me to feel superior to my brother because in my moral universe, my brand of crime is not as heinous as his? I am Rodney creature of the mean streets of New York City, a thief by trade, wrestling with myself over some of lifes little problems. Come along, hitch a ride!" />
