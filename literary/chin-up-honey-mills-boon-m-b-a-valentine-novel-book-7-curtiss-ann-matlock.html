  <title>Chin Up, Honey (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (A Valentine Novel, Book 7) - Curtiss Ann Matlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;It takes a lot of work to plan a wedding–and even more to save a marriage–but in Valentine, Oklahoma, there&#39;s always someone to help you keep your chin up.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emma Cole&#39;s son is getting married, and she&#39;s determined to make everything perfect–even if that means asking her estranged husband to come home and pretend they&#39;re still together. John may be an imperfect husband, but he&#39;s a devoted dad. He&#39;s happy to oblige Emma–especially since he didn&#39;t really much like living apart from her anyway. Now he wants a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Emma sorts through the mess of her own marriage, she puts her heart into planning Valentine&#39;s wedding of the century. But there&#39;s one big problem: the bride&#39;s ambitious mother wants more for her daughter than marriage to a small-town boy. As the wedding approaches, the many meanings of love, commitment and happiness capture the hearts of folks in town. And surrounded by the warmth and spirit of her neighbors, Emma starts to see new beginnings instead of endings.&lt;/p&gt;
