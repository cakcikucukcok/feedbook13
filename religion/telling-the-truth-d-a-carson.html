  <title>Telling the Truth - D. A. Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A pre-modern baseball umpire would have said something like this: &#39;There&#39;s balls, and there&#39;s strikes, and I call &#39;em as they are.&#39; The modernist would have said, &#39;There&#39;s balls, and there&#39;s strikes, and I call &#39;em as I see &#39;em.&#39; And the postmodernist umpire would say, &#39;They ain&#39;t nothing until I call &#39;em.&#39;&quot; With that humorous quote, Ravi Zacharias illustrates the challenge postmodernism poses to Christians passionate about evangelism. How do you communicate truth to a world that isn&#39;t sure what truth is--or even if truth is? How do you commend spiritual absolutes to people who insist there are none? If you&#39;ve puzzled, even struggled, over such questions, the book you hold in your hands is required reading, Telling the Truth provides informed insights on the heart of the Gospel, the soul of postmodern culture, and their complex interface. This book is a compilation of thoughts and strategies from twenty-nine prominent practitioners of contemporary evangelism. Originating at a three-day conference held at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Telling the Truth draws on knowledge gained in the trenches by Ravi Zacharias, Kelly Monroe, D.A. Carson, Ajith Fernando, and other notables. It will open your eyes to how the contest for souls is fought, guerilla-style, at a multitude of fronts: relationships, the university, ethnicity, reason and emotion, the pulpit, communications . . . in short, the broad spectrum of human experience and values. You&#39;ll be challenged to discern between the unchanging Gospel and the flexible means by which we communicate it. Telling the Truth can help you lay the groundwork necessary to point biblically uninformed, postmodern men and women toward an encounter with non-negotiable truth -- an absolute revealed in the Bible that points to the reality of sin and the need for a Savior." />
