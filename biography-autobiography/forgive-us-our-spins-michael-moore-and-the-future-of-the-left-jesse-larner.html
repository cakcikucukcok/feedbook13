  <title>Forgive Us Our Spins: Michael Moore and the Future of the Left - Jesse Larner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Well written, witty, and wise. Jesse Larner&#39;s book goes well beyond its brief: it helps us understand where the left has been going for the last few years, and where it might end up.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;GEORGE MONBIOT, columnist, The Guardian (UK)&lt;p&gt;&quot;Forgive Us Our Spins is a very smart and well-researched book about the ever-controversial Michael Moore. Larner does a great job at showing why Moore&#39;s political and cultural adventures often do more damage than good. And Larner is a man of the left who doesn&#39;t make excuses for the right. A concern for decency and the quality of public discussion in this country shine through in this book&amp;#151;a healthy antidote to not just Michael Moore but also the intellectual clowns of the right, like Ann Coulter and Michael Savage. Let&#39;s hope Larner&#39;s voice is heard by many.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;KEVIN MATTSON, professor, Ohio University, and author of Upton Sinclair and the Other American Century&lt;p&gt;As the 2004 presidential election approached, Michael Moore repeatedly expressed confidence that his film Fahrenheit 9/11 would have a powerful impact on the outcome of that bitter contest. The talking cogs in the right-wing media machine were happy to agree with him. They foresaw that Moore and his flawed, shallow, and factually sloppy film would be major factors in motivating and energizing their base. &lt;p&gt;Left, right, or in between, everyone has an opinion about Michael Moore. His books reside on bestseller lists, his films are unfailingly controversial, and his politics range far to the left of any elected official on the national scene. So why is he the only voice capable of bringing progressive issues and ideas to public awareness? What message should the Democratic Party glean from his immense popularity? What impact will Moore and his work have on the future of the left?&lt;p&gt;In Forgive Us Our Spins, you&#39;ll meet Michael Moore as you&#39;ve never seen him before. This witty, well-written critique of America&#39;s most commercially successful radical examines Moore&#39;s life and work, reveals the personal history that underlies his political passions, and takes a clear-eyed look at his controversial trouble with the facts. &lt;p&gt;Love him or hate him, you can&#39;t deny Michael Moore&#39;s political stature. Is he the champion the left has long yearned for or the kind of friend that&#39;s more dangerous than an enemy? Read Forgive Us Our Spins, then decide." />
