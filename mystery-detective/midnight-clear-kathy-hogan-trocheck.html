      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ex-Atlanta cop-turned-house-cleaning entrepreneur Callahan Garrity doesn&#39;t know what she is getting for Christmas, but she never expects the gift that arrives at her door: her estranged, ne&#39;er-do-well brother, Brian, and his adorable three-year-old daughter, Maura. A rebel who&#39;s been in and out of trouble most of his life, Brian&#39;s deep in it now since he illegally abducted Maura from under the nose of his shrewish former wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the beautiful child&#39;s mother is found murdered, the police come looking for Brian. And now, to save her brother and her holiday, Callahan -- along with her irascible mom, Edna, and a gaggle of House Mouse employees -- must uncover the truth and a killer, even if it means digging around the roots of her own family tree and exposing the rot underneath.&lt;/p&gt;" />
