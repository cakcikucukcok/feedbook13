  <title>Charlie the Cocky Rooster - Dovie Pilney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlie the rooster is still the leader of the pack.
In this adventure the little animals meet Chit Chat the rat.
Chit chat loves to tell stories and make them rhyme.
He can&#39;t figure out why he does this all the time.
He told Charlie, &quot;This cat would chase me everywhere in the barn.
I just knew she was mean enough to do me harm.
Seeing her long claws scared me half to death.
All I could think ofwas to was to hold my breath.
It was as though we were playing the game, &quot;Catch me ifyou can.&quot;
So I just ran, ran and ran.
I&#39;d fmd a place I thought was safe.
I&#39;d turn around and all I could see was her angry face.
The closest place I could fmd was a horse stall.
I suddenly seen a hole in the wall.
Crawled through it with no trouble at all.
I&#39;ll bet she&#39;d like to play that game once more.
I&#39;d like to play a trick on her to even the score.
I hope I never see that stupid cat again.
This game is certainly called, &quot;Catch me if you can.&quot;
Remember this is another adventure with the animals you adore.
Will Chit Chat the rat go back to see the cat and even the score?
You will definitely want to read more." />
