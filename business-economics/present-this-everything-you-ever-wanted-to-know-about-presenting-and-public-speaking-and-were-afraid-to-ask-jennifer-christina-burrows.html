  <title>Present This!: EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT PRESENTING AND PUBLIC SPEAKING AND WERE AFRAID TO ASK - Jennifer Christina Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Present This; everything you ever wanted to know about presenting and public speaking and were afraid to ask&quot; is a conversation about public speaking and presentation skills from those who do it best, real people whose success lives and dies on the ability to communicate a message.   Providing insights into not only WHAT successful speakers and presenters do to achieve their results, but importantly, HOW they think, the tools they use and the actions they take, will make a difference to your business success.   In today&#39;s busy business environment, there is no substitute for face-to-face communication.  Truth be told, face to face communication is more vital to business than ever before. However, never has face-to-face communication been so challenging! There is less time to prepare and less time to listen. Business people are demanding.  They want specific information, not generalisations, and equally they want empathy and understanding of their issues. And what is said must stand out against the thousands of messages that business people receive every day.  The need to engage, influence and build relationships is ever more important to business success.  Present This provides you  with the tools, strategies and overall confidence essential for speaking success making a significant difference  to your life and  your career." />
